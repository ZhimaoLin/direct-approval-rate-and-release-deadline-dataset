Patch Set 2: Verified-1

Line:94, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> pls follow pep8 stds: line length must not be over 79 chars, i.e, all text needs to be within the red line you see at 80 chars.

Line:99, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> It's not a good idea to curl from a test code. The rest_client.py should house the code. And it should be called from test class as rest.create_beer_sample_bucket or something if not present already.

Line:104, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> it is said  the %s format will likely go away in py 3.x, so the more the %s in our code, harder the transition to py3 in future. Fine for now, going forward, we may want to use string .format() method to print.

Line:110, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> Trying to understand prefixes and suffixes - what are we validating here?

Line:124, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> why is there an option to delete sample bucket?

Line:126, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> I'm sure there's an existing delete bucket method that takes bucket name. Kindly use that.

Line:94, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> is the pep8 guideline correct here? on my pycharm (which tracks pep8 by default) the code is all behind the line. I have noticed our Jasmin Rangel guidelines differs from pycharm. I have been going with the pycharm lines thus far.

Line:99, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> i based this off code in test_travel_sample, it was the only place i could find where a sample bucket was actually loaded. If you are adamant it should be a function  I can crete one inside of rest_client. Please let me know

Line:110, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> basically we want to make sure that the index using suffixes is used by default (rather than the defaulty created index). That is the essence of this improvement. So we look at the plan to make sure the index created above is the one used

Line:124, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> the way the rest of the 90 some odd tests are written will fail if beer-sample remains after this test run

Line:126, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> will do.

Line:94, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> Correct, you may want to set your pycharm preferences to set line length to 79 chars.Pls see- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17319422/where-to-set-maximum-line-length-in-pycharm

Line:99, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> Sure, pls create a method inside rest_client.py. TNathalie Landrys a great deal about code reusability. Others can use your method too going forward.

Line:110, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> ok, thanks

Line:124, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_2i_index.py -> ok
