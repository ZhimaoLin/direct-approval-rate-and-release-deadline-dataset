DESCRIPTION

MB-26900: tests should use "clusterCompatibility" field from /pools/default to determine if cluster is 5.0
Added a method in the rest client to check if the cluster is compatible with a given version or not. We now check clusterCompatibility from /pools/default instead of getting the versions directly from /pools/default.

Line:1954, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Bharath, can I get the logic of comparison outside rest_client. Let rest client only return results of rest call.
