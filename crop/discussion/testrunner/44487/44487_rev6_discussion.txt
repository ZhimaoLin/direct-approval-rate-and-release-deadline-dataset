Line:57, lib/couchbase_helper/tuq_generators.py -> should be true by default to follow logic that i had for n1ql

Line:61, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> i think it has to be ["children"] for rest api

Line:64, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> i think there should be self.assertEqual(actual_index_name, query_definition.index_name) and a break

Line:66, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> if you want to use return i think here should be self.fail(msg)

Line:77, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> does self.query exists here? may be we need to define it here also

Line:78, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> this one can be omitted, if there is no expected _result --> create it and then run_cbq_query

Line:82, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> can be also run_cbq_query(query=self.gen_results.query)

Line:117, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> i think there should be a variable also, which will contain list of indexes currently created, because if for example we attempted create 3 indexes, 2 of them are cerated, and 1 no, there will be nothing to drop for 3d index and you will have one more trace

Line:148, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> we have this method again? may be is better to put it into a common class?

Line:51, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> i think there need to be added a check for sherlock version, if i run tests with dp4 i would like to have this variable as False

Line:1493, pytests/basetestcase.py -> do we need to raise an exception here that we don't have enough nodes for test?

Line:142, lib/couchbase_helper/query_definitions.py -> I think here can be useful a break

Line:61, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> It seemed to work with http, r u sure?

Line:64, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> Nope, we are iterating thru a list and when we find we return. I cannot assert as this will fail when not true, even though we expect to be present in list

Line:66, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> makes sense

Line:77, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> will do, thanks for the tip

Line:117, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> great idea

Line:148, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> as discussed will keep it here. And move it out later. As it will break my code. We inherit base_2i from newtuq and it does not have this method defined

Line:51, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> you should add this in another fix. Does not cover my changes

Line:142, lib/couchbase_helper/query_definitions.py -> we have to iterate through everything to make sure we get all query definitions with related groups. Break does not make sense here
