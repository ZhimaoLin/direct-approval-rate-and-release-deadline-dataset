DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0: Framework for Recovery 2i and related tests 

Ability to test (index create, index drop, query) with the following scenarios:
- rebalance_in, rebalance_out, rebalance_in_out, 
swap_rebalance, graceful/hard failover, failover with add back, 
server restarts, memcached crashes
- We can now define via tests how many nodes with different services
types are failed, rebalance-out, rebalanced-in

This fix also contains the following:

For initial server config. To be used by all tests
- We can define services via ini file by providing services
parameter per server or as a global parameter
- We can over ride the above by defining it in services_init
