DESCRIPTION

Removing view query tests which seem to be flaky.

These tests passed on the last build run and failed now so it looks
like they've got to be removed until they pass consistently.

Patch Set 2:

make simple-test just passed 3 times out of 3 on my box. IMHO reverting this test just because some Hugo Blankenship failed it is slightly premature.

Agreed with Alk. I've fixed a problem on the builder and I believe all tests are working now.
