DESCRIPTION

Revert "CBQA-3530 fix test key stats"

This reverts commit 9e9fa107e063ac0878cf8ddf8068265b40921bfa.
The change is causing test failures in other areas since in tasks.py, we are sending string as opposed to complete bucket info to the execute_cbstats. Need to fix the complete tasks.py first and then the change can be made. Reverting the change for now.
