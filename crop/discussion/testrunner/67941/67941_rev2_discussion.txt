DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3580: Fix the failing gracefulcli tests on 4.7 builds
Fixed the failing gracefulCLI tests on 4.7 builds due to product changes in cli output. Also added port as input to all the graceful cli commands since the cli commands now take port too with the localhost address. Updated the output to reflect the latest changes from cli output.
