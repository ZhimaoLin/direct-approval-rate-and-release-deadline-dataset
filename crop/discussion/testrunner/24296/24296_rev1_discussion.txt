DESCRIPTION

CBQE-999 Fix testrunner hang in test_create_delete_similar_views

The Cluster() thread created by the test needs to be shutdown.
Otherwise testrunner hangs after executing the test.
Also added sleep between view create and query.
The test was failing sometimes due to view not available at time of query
