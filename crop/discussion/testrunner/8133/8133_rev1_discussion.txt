DESCRIPTION

modified testrunner to work with 256 vbuckets

modified testrunner to work with 256 vbuckets by getting the number
from the /pools/default/{bucket}
so far we were assuming that there are only 1024 vbuckets in membase
installation but for 2.0 this number might change to 256 or 512 or 128t
