Patch Set 2:

Sent out the patch before seeing Tommie's comments. Will address them as well. In Patch 2 I kept the old function as it is, and added a new one. The test code never uses the flawed call as of now.

Patch Set 2:

in your second commit we lost meaning is_cluster_rebalanced.  is_cluster_rebalanced = is it rebalance required? isRebalanceRunning has a different meaning
