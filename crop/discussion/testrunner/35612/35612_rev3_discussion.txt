Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

(4 comments)

Line:1128, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> best practise is not use method like is...Not...

Line:1134, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> firstly we should find "type":"rebalance" task(iterate through all tasks)

Line:1135, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> if 'status' not in json it means rebalance  not running. but you return false ( = rebalance is running)

Line:1148, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> API gives: Not found.

Patch Set 3:

This API is discontinued. if you lookup /pools/default. I need to follow-up

Line 1148:         api = self.baseUrl + 'pools/default/rebalanceStatuses?waitChange=1'
API gives: Not found.

Currently, our code doesn't use it. But it might break things elsewhere, have to follow-up with Alk
