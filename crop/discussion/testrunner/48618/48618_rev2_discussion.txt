Seems like you forgot to add config file with the list of the tests?

Line:21, pytests/sg/sgconfigtests.py -> seems like the same presetup could be done with https://github.com/membase/testrunner/blob/master/pytests/basetestcase.py#L347
but let's leave it until, so just add in the comments that it is better to rewrite it

Line:16, pytests/sg/sg_config_base.py -> seems like you don't need use super here

Line:117, pytests/sg/sg_config_base.py -> config_file  never used?

Line:333, pytests/sg/sg_config_base.py -> you have very many if inner conditions. for example, above _if_logic could be replaced with "if self.email and xxx@xxx.xxx in self.email and '.' in self.email and ...."

also please use elif instead of "else if" where it's possible

Line:1, pytests/sg/resources/gateway_config_test.json -> I think this file never used in the tests?

Line:6, pytests/sg/resources/gateway_config_test.json -> btw, how we should track this hardcoded IPs when we run on jenkins vms for example?
