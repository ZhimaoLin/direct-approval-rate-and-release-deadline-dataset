Hi Prasanna,

I recommend using separate Cluster objects to isolate taskManagers rather than making the single cluster object support multiple taskManagers.  The reason being this pattern would require function definition change of every method in cluster.py to support an alternative taskManager, whereas a new Cluster object will instantly come with a new task manager.

Line:3, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> remove

Line:35, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> see comment from previous test... recommend creating new Cluster objects than low-level task managers

Line:3, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> remove

Line:67, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> instead of creating new TaskManager, create a new cluster Object which itself will have its own task manager

Line:96, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> i.e _ with comment above, having a new cluster object this would be

create_index_task = index_cluster.async_create_index(...)

Line:65, lib/couchbase_helper/cluster.py -> Don't recommend passing in task_manager, this pattern doesn't scale.  It's better for external consumers to create new instances of cluster.py
