DESCRIPTION

change test log level when running tests

change the arg parsing to use optionparsing module
and changed the logging method to create a dynamically generated
logging configuration when running each test

testrunner creates a logging.conf file under the tmp
folder and uses logging.config.fileConfig to use that
conf file
