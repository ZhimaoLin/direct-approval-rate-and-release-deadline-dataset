Patch Set 4:

Changed one of the log()'s back to a print() for usability.  It now emits something like...


[2011-10-10 12:06:38,495] - [mcsoda] [140735087623360] - INFO - first 5 keys...
echo get cfcd208495d565ef | nc 10.2.1.50 11211
echo get c4ca4238a0b92382 | nc 10.2.1.50 11211
echo get c81e728d9d4c2f63 | nc 10.2.1.50 11211
echo get eccbc87e4b5ce2fe | nc 10.2.1.50 11211
echo get a87ff679a2f3e71d | nc 10.2.1.50 11211

The idea is that's now friendly for copy-&-paste for me.  Previously, it would emit something less-copy-&-pastable, like...

[2011-10-10 12:05:02,334] - [mcsoda] [140735087623360] - INFO - first 5 keys...
