Patch Set 3: Verified+1

Sangharsh, Andrei,

The code is now ready for review. Kindly review the code and leave your comments.

I've moved pause_replication() and resume_replication() to xdcrbasetests.py from my initial implementation in rest_client.py so we can call post_pause_validations() and post_resume_validations inside the respective functions to reduce the complexity of coding in the caller because in bi-directional replication the concept of source and destination is based on a reference and this is dynamic based on the which side the operation is performed. 

I've added comments as needed. 

The method to test the framework(by adding pause and resume steps in a test) and the output seen in testrunner can be found at -

Thanks.
