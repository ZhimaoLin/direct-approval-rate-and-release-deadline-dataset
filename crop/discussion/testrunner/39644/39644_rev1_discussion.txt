Line:259, pytests/xdcr/checkpointXDCR.py -> Can we count 404 errors before beginning of the test to get actual number of 404 errors during the test itself.

Line:259, pytests/xdcr/checkpointXDCR.py -> We can but it would not be useful. Here we have to add this because post dest rebalance/failover of node containing vb0, we will get 404 and that failure is not recorded on the new node containing vb0. So the first pre-replicate to new node will pass.
