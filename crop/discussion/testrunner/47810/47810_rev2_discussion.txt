DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0: Add robustness to simultaneous index creation

Had issues in concurrent index creation where requests
got routed to the same index node. Adding delay per request.

When an issue came as mentioned above, the task manager would hang
as it never was set to FINISHED state. Fixed it
