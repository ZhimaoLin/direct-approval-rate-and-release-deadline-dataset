DESCRIPTION

CBQE:3685- Create a structure to encapsulate bucket creation params.
I changed cluster.py's create bucket commands to accept a dict. I also added a method inside cluster.py that takes in bucket parameters and returns a dict that contains those parameters. This dict is then passed to the create bucket commands which then passes those to the CreateBucketTask. Inside CreateBucketTask the dictionary is unpacked and the parameters are sent to the rest_client.create_bucket command. The rest of the changes are everywhere that the cluster create bucket commands are used. The conf file I changed was to fix the spelling of structure, I also fixed the affected tests method header to spell structure correctly. Finally I modified BaseTestCase to create dicts and then send them to the cluster create calls, essentially just modified BaseTestCase to work with the above changes.

UPDATE:in addition to the above changes I have refactored BaseTestCase to createa dictionary of default parameters for cluster to use.The dictionary contains keys to signify which type of bucket it is the default for.
	ex. self.base_params['sasl'] contains the sasl default params.
 I have also modified cluster's create bucket method headers again to take in a name parameter. Standard and memcached bucket creators also take in a port parameter.
