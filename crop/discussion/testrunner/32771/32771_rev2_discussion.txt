Line:10, pytests/failover/failoverbasetests.py -> -Why are we using xxx@xxx.xxx for setup and teardowns functions vs init for the base classes. Is there some advantage we gain by this?
-Also curious to know why can't the setup and teardown() cannot be a regular object method.

Line:10, pytests/failover/failoverbasetests.py -> no reason - looks like legacy, I'll address this in next patch.

currently we inherit from BaseTestCase because it sets up some needed params for setup.
