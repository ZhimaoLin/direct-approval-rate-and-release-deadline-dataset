Thanks a lot Daniel!  My concern is the change in collect options.  Maybe this can be an Arg Variable like ex_args="--single-node-diag",  where these would be used only in local mode.

Line:3467, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> We need diags on all the nodes.  But looks like this change will restrict collection to single node

" --single-node-diag    collect per-node diag on just this node (default is
                        all reachable nodes)"

Also, can you comment why the --initargs= is needed?

Line:3466, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> thanks - will fix

Line:3467, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> The parameters were taken from looking how we get the logs when you click collect logs from all nodes in the UI.  I will experiment with removing --single-node diag and not using --initargs.
