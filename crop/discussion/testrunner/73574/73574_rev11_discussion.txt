DESCRIPTION

MB-22707: Capture the logs when using cluster_run

Some tests are run against a cluster set-up using cluster_run.  If
there is a test failure we would like to capture the logs so they can
be analysed off-line.

This patch introduces a new parameter get_logs_cluster_run which
if set to true, on a test failure will create a zip file of the
ns_server/logs directory and place the file in the testrunner log
directory.
