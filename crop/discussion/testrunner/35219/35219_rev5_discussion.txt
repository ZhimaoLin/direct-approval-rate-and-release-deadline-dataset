Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:314, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> This function is not part of xdcrbasetests.py, while it is in rebalanceXDCR.py only. If needed, you can move to xdcrbasetests.py accordingly or create here.

Line:380, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> I think this test is subset of test above this? You can make that test as generic to work on one bucket or more.

Line:408, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> __merge_buckets function is declare/defined in rebalanceXDCR.py only. We can move it to base class i.e.XDCRRepicationBaseTest.

One trivial comment, all previous comments were invalid.

Line:388, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> We can add check if there is no replication going on that paused bucket. I mean we can throw exception is it is still replicating at paused bucket.
