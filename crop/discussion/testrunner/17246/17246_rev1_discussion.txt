DESCRIPTION

MB-100: cmd_get graph climbing-up issue

First of all, this might affect current eperf results, \
because mcsoda used num_ops as one of the inputs \
for key generation.

For clients other than master (prefix=0), \
mcsoda caculated and passed in offset (start_at) \
for all GET cmds. This led to a bump of \
doing all SETs no GETs in the beginning of access phase.
