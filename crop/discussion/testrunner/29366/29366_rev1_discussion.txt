CBQE reference should go first, prior to message

Line:12, pytests/csvdatatest.py -> this parameter exists in BaseTestCase

Line:18, pytests/csvdatatest.py -> self.master?

Line:31, pytests/csvdatatest.py -> execute_cbtransfer command exists

Line:38, pytests/csvdatatest.py -> what for do you create a new one?

Line:40, pytests/csvdatatest.py -> create 2 buckets putting a parameter into conf file (this option exists in basetestcase)
and then work with them for bucket in self.buckets: <your_actions_items>

Line:46, pytests/csvdatatest.py -> rest already exists

Line:51, pytests/csvdatatest.py -> bucket_info['basicStats'] is more understandable rather than cycles and ifs

Line:52, pytests/csvdatatest.py -> asserEqual(self.num_items, bucket_info['itemCount'], "<your_message>")
but you don't really need all this, just call verify_cluster_stats, it will check items according to kv_store

Line:2, conf/py-csvdatatest.conf -> should this test go separately? RecoveryUseTransferTests exists
