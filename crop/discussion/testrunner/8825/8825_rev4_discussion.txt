Patch Set 4:

I did a fresh checkout of testrunner and pytests/management/install.py seemed to already have the rest.init_cluster_memoryQuota(memoryQuota=nodeinfo.mcdMemoryReserved) change committed.

With this change, as long as you don't set the memoryQuota manually, it should default to the max system memory available.
