Line:740, pytests/viewtests.py -> the same waiting

Line:991, pytests/viewtests.py -> verification _verify_docs_doc_name exists in _delete_docs method

Line:71, pytests/viewtests.py -> we are not using the return value of extract_remote_info

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

refactoring looks good!  I would hold off from too much clean up as some of this code will be replaced by task manager.
