Line:92, lib/testconstants.py -> this is not referred anywhere, are you sure this changeset is complete?

Line:35, lib/tasks/task.py -> Can we always print which client is being used? The above if forces printing only when mc_bin_client is used.

Line:92, lib/testconstants.py -> We use this change only for tasks.py. Python SDK was only used in tasks.py
