Patch Set 3: (7 inline comments)



Line:417, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> You need to add comments to this... function. 

http://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/QA/QE+Coding+Guidelines

Line:438, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> why do we need node.port to be the key?
Lets keep key simple.

Line:914, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> If you want to change it to lowercase. change it in the whole file.... else.. add make it as a separate commit..

Although i still dont agree changing it to small.. makes it easy to see, if its in CAPITAL.. when looking at the logs on jenkins console. 

@Farshid: ?

Line:918, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> monitor is true by default..for add_rebalance_task

Line:939, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> no hardcoding..

Line:959, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> monitor is true by default..for add_rebalance_task

Line:43, conf/py-181-kv-rebalance-tests.conf -> load-ratio=66/67.. since low_wat is 65..

i think you also need to set keys_count to -1

Patch Set 3:

@Farshid: I suggested Luca Rhodes to add the checkResident ratio as a helper method to our existing rebalance in/out test cases.. 

The conf file has the test, which we want to run with different 
replica counts, items count etc.
