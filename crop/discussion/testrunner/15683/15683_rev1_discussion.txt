Line:414, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> Why is this a static method if it takes "self" as a parameter?  Shouldn't it just be a regular method?

Line:419, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> What is special about 5?

Line:437, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> Do you really intend to make this many memcached stats calls showing different points in time instead of just grabbing them all at once and printing them out?

Line:445, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> If you're going to use the same key for all these hash tables, I think it'd be a lot easier if you just computed it once and called it "key" or something.

Line:458, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> It's not clear what you think (int) means here, but it's rather odd looking.

Line:979, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> You really shouldn't be calling methods on other classes with an instance that isn't a member of that class.  It may happen to work, but will break really horribly.

Any reason this isn't just an instance of RebalanceBaseTest?

Line:1011, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> This code looks pretty identical to the code above.

Line:1071, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> This really looks like it wants to be a method call, but it's lying about its base class.  That's going to cause problems.

Line:1083, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> This too.

Patch Set 1: (6 inline comments)

this test needs to be rewritten. I am working on it right now to remove some of the redundant code and fix the log statements.
lets's avoid having "captial letters" in the log statement and also we should not be using print statement.

using time.sleep() is not a good idea for this test ( e.g for warmup test we had to use time.sleep() on some cases waiting for the memcached process to restart )

Line:414, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> this method can be part of the test case because it contains logic to pass/fail the test case .
it is not written as a generic method so let's not make this a utility method

Line:419, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> we shouldn't be sleeping for 5 seconds here

Line:437, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> fixed

Line:445, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> fixed

Line:458, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> yes this should be int(..)

Line:979, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> all the other tests are written in a similar way . they dont extend the base class and instead use the static methods.

in the new rewrite of rebalance tests in taskmanager branch we are inheritance.

Line:979, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> also im not too happy about the common setup method which is assigning values self.xxx varaibles. 
@karan : we should really avoid this on the new rewrite stuff.
