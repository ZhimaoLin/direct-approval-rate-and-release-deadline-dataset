Patch Set 4: Do not submit

(2 inline comments)

this is breaking ccluster_run compatibility.

please run make simple-tests and some of the tests in test-view against checking in the code.

Line:611, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> the default value here should be len(self.input.servers)

Line:641, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> this doesn't work for cluster_run . we need to compare ip:port
