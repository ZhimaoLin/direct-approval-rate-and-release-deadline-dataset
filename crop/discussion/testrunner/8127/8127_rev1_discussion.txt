Patch Set 1:

how does the rolling upgrade test work here ?

the scenario should be :

have x nodes with 1.7.0
upgrade one of the nodes to 1.7.1
without restarting those 1.7.0 nodes we install 1.7.1 on a new node
and then add the 1.7.1 node to the cluster
and we rebalance in
if rebalance succeeds we rebalance out one of the 1.7.0 nodes from the cluster
