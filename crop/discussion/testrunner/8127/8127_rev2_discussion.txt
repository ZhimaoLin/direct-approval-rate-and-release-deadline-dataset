looks good.
had one minor comment.

did you also check if key_exists method is used anywhere else ?

Line:567, pytests/upgradetests.py -> there should be a 5 minutes delay here otherwise we will hit the tap 5 minutes bug

I did change the one other spot (backup/restore) where this is used, but let me verify that change works before this is merged

Patch Set 2:

backup/restore looks good, though we need to fix the restore tests to work with centos (because by default it only has python 2.4)
