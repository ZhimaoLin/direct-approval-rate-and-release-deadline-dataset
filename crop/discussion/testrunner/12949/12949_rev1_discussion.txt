Line:743, pytests/viewtests.py -> I think we should add this check to 
def _verify_docs_doc_name

This check is good and needed.

Line:743, pytests/viewtests.py -> I don't think so. The test suite does the same things several times. This makes them slower and harder to find problems. Whenever you change data, you should check for persistence. This means that this check should rather be added to the delete and update functions as well. But that's not the scope of this patch.
