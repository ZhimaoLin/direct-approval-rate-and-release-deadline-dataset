With 3.0 the new param : evictionPolicy=fullEviction is enabled. This change adds this option to the basetests and related file changes.

thx Amani Conrad.  also to ensure compatibility with old tests, I suggest put new arg at end of method and assign default method as some tests still directly call cluster.create_default_bucket.

Line:1333, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> is this the default?  in params it's set to 'valueOnly'

Line:20, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> suggest making this last argument and providing default value = '', or whatever the default is 'valueOnly' ?

Line:195, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> same as async method.  having as 2nd arg will break several testsâ€¦

Patch Set 1:

Will do as the last argument.

However, the new param eviction_policy by default is assigned 'valueOnly' on the basetests.

self.eviction_policy=self.input.param("eviction_policy", 'valueOnly')

But I get your point of other tests, so will change this across the calls.
