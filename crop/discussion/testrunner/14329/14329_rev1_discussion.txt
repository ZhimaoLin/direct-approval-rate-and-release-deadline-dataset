Line:700, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> whitespace

Line:702, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> we should use zlib crc32 instead. another option is to just make crc32.crc32_hash wrap the zlib version so we don't have to modify much code

(zlib.crc32(key) >> 16) & (len(self.vBucketMap) - 1)

Line:708, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> whitespace

Line:709, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> instead of looping can we just use the vBucket.id as an index? seems like it could be really slow to update all the vbuckets.

Line:760, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> what is this if block supposed to wrap? the following line isn't indented

also whitespace
