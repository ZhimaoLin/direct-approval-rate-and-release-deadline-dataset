Line:49, scripts/start_cluster_and_run_tests.py -> I'm not sure what the intention is here.. Isn't it just to run the old "dataclean" target? Thats still available in "ns_server", but unfortunately only for gnu make, BUT you can run "ns_dataclean" in the directory "ns_server/build"..

Line:51, scripts/start_cluster_and_run_tests.py -> The current change cause a full remake to be done... Personally I think running ns_dataclean should be sufficient here.. the user should have built everything they wanted "up front"..
