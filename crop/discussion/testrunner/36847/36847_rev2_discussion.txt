Line:51, scripts/start_cluster_and_run_tests.py -> Add + "/build"

Line:57, scripts/start_cluster_and_run_tests.py -> You must use the ${MAKE} passed to make (it's named nmake on windows, and on my solaris box make is not gnu make etc). In addition the dataclean-target in ns_server/build is named ns_dataclean (the makefile in ns_server is a gnu-make only makefile"

Line:64, scripts/start_cluster_and_run_tests.py -> Need os.chdir("..")
