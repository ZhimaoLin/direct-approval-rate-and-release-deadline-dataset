Luca Rhodes,  thanks for quick fix.

Is it possible to test it on Jenkens before merging to make sure it works? 

If not,  before merging the fix, please run the xdcr-basic test on 1-1 and 3-3 cluster configurations, which is the same as Jenkens, just make it it is clean. 


Please see minor comment in the code.

Line:188, pytests/xdcr.py -> good catch! please fix to cluster_ref_a or delete it if not referenced in the test.

Line:231, pytests/xdcr.py -> see the comment above.
