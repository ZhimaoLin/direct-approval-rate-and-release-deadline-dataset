DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Add linux and windows couchbase bin path to test constants

Remove the previous things like linux_couchbase_backup_path, because for
cbbackup, cbrestore and cbtransfer they share the same parent path.
This change will make the code more concise. I will commit another change
for functions in remote.util which involve cbbackup, cbrestore and cbtransfer
according to this change.
