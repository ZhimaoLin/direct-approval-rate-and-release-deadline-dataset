CBQE part of commit message should go first
And as I can see this commit should depend on http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/29059/

Line:40, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> why it is hardcoded? you have self.product param

Line:44, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> if not servers:
    servers = self.servers ?

Line:51, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> if 
i will have only one version,for example 2.2.0. Couchbase will be installed only on one server?

Line:58, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> we don't need format here as i can see. Also do we really need to restart all server for all cases?

Line:151, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> what the difference self.initial_cluster and self.nodes_init

Line:153, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> did you build initial cluster? after changing hostnames servers are reinitialized

Line:154, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> servs_in = self.servers[self.nodes_init:self.nodes_in + self.nodes_init] ?

Line:156, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> cluster.rebalance(...)
we don't need asynchronous method here

Line:160, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> of {0}

Line:161, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> it seems like here should be nodes_in and above nodes_init

Line:164, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> no need in async method

Line:172, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> shell.disconnect

Line:139, pytests/rebalance/rebalanceinout.py -> please create one method for all clases for changing hostname

Line:200, pytests/rebalance/rebalanceinout.py -> again, create one method for all classes

Line:279, lib/tasks/task.py -> using hostname from the nodes/self will be quicker
