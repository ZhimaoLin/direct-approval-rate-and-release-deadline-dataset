Partially reviewed and added comments in the file.

Line:44, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> servers=None in the argument is not iterable. It should *if servers == None" or if servers: ...

Line:61, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> I think we can pass sleep time from the configuration file, so that it can be changed based on the some facts e.g. number of nodes in the cluster, data load etc.

Line:65, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> Please add assert that length of self.servers should not be less than 3. Please do the same in next tests also accordingly to avoid index out of range errors.
