Line:315, lib/couchbase_helper/documentgenerator.py -> for create, we are returning just the doc whereas for delete, we still seem to be returning a list of docs.

Line:317, lib/couchbase_helper/documentgenerator.py -> the update method needs iterator style implementation too. I suggest we tackle this as a separate commit. For now, we can just focus on subprocess to merge things sooner.
