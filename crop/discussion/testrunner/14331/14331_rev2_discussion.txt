DESCRIPTION

added simple rebalance test to load/verify data during rebalance

this test uses the new rebalance load generator to
load data during rebalance.
it uses a local cache to remember what key,value pairs were
inserted to the database or which values were deleted.
once rebalancing is completed the test verifies that
the deleted items are still marked as deleted.

in order to use this new load generator the client needs to
specify , bucket name , size of the data and number of items to be
inserted and the ops to be executed.
once the load is finished it uses the local cache(kvstore) and compare
the values in the local kvstore versus the cluster
