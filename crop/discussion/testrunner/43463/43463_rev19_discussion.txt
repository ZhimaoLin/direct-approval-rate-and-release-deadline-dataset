DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2485:: Integrate python SDK to testrunner

Including the python sdk gives us the advantage of finding more bugs within the sdk, plus uses it stability for testrunner.

In addition, it gives us additional functionality.

See: http://pythonhosted.org//couchbase/index.html

We will be using the latest SDK (master branch) which is backward compatible with 1.8

As can seen below the functionality not supported by the python client are very few and can be added by requesting the devs.

Difference between python sdk and current mc_bin_client
1) Common possible operations: delete, add, set, get, getr, get_multi, delete, observe, replace, incr, decr, sync_mutation, sync_persistence, cas, getl
2) Operations only in Python SDK:
- multi operations (getr, delete, set, observe, replace, incr, decr, add).
- Has support for views and querying.
- In Sherlock we will have support for n1ql and 2i operations as well.
- Has the ability to be quiet on errors
- Is more stable during vbucket moves as compared to mc_bin_client based implementations which give us memcached errors (false alarms)
- Different transcoder can be used
- SSL based connections with couchbase server
3)Operations only in mc_bin_client:
- getMeta which gets us rev id
- noop operation
- Setting flags is direct meanwhile Python SDK can set flags by choosing a data format.

Some tests that check our implementation
 ./testrunner -i ../palm.ini  -t sdk_client_tests.sdk_client_tests.SDKClientTests.test_sdk_client,items=3

Also, we will make a major change to resolve conflict with lib/couchbase with couchbase (python sdk based). This will involve changes to a lot of files in testrunner.
