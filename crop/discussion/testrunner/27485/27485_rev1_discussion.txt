Line:55, pysystests/tools/plotter.py -> Will this REST call download the pdf report?

Line:126, pysystests/tools/plotter.py -> I don't think ns_server_db string contains ":"? What's this for?

Line:126, pysystests/tools/plotter.py -> Sorry Andrei, I got the point of this catch. When user store 127.0.0.1:9000 in testcfg.py for CLUSTER_IP, ns_server_db will be something like ns_serverdefaultdefault127001:9000. That's a great bug fix

Line:55, pysystests/tools/plotter.py -> [19:54:12] Titus Ho: wow, missed this - thx
[19:55:08] Titus Ho: interestingâ€¦ did the snapshot url change to /cbmonitor/pdf ?
[19:55:55] Esperanza Cherry: are you saying about http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/27485/1/pysystests/tools/plotter.py
[19:56:02] Titus Ho: yah
[19:56:38] Esperanza Cherry: we can't get pdf report if we did't generate it before
[19:57:02] Esperanza Cherry: manually or  = requests.post('http://%s:8000/cbmonitor/pdf/' % cfg.SERIESLY_IP, data={'snapshot':snapshot_n
[19:57:11] Titus Ho: right! thought that was me doing something wrong

so, post  command has the same result as when we press "PDF" button.

Line:55, pysystests/tools/plotter.py -> i'm wondering now if its possible that cbmonitor has 2 similar api's?  for instance Roland Charles is doing a GET with the snapshot name in the path, but  this change does a POST with snapshot name in the data payload.

probably we should use whichever one is used by the ui- i'm assuming the POST here

Line:55, pysystests/tools/plotter.py -> Yeah, Andrei I see your point. That's a correct REST call. POST request "press" the pdf bottom to generate the report. And then we can download it. But report generation takes a while after we press the pdf bottom. Do we consider it already?
