DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-267: Integrate monster to testrunner

The current implementation assumes that monster tool is installed on the local box and we can run it via python.

All the required files for monster are checkedin and will be modified as required.

Code Example Usage:

x =  JsonGenerator()
map = x.execute_json_data_generator(
    "go run ~/gocode/src/github.com/Leonel Abbott/monster/monster/monster.go ",
        key_extension=  "key", bag_dir = "bags/",
            pod_path = "prod/projects.prod", num_items = 10, seed = 1)

print map

Hi Pratap: have resolved your comment. That was some noise from my implementation. Have removed it. The executable path is passed into the json generator function. We can vary it based on our usage.
