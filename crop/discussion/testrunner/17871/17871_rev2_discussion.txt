Line:737, lib/tasks/task.py -> log after the node is failed over

for node in nodes: --> for node in rest.node_statuses:
so that we refresh the list after the node is failed over

does this support the master node being failed over now ?

Line:737, lib/tasks/task.py -> added for node in rest.node_statuses in next patch
logging after fail over is already being handled in the rest call both in case of success and failure. 
master node can be failed over with this.
