Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I did not vote for these changes. Any client should be able to handle the error. if we can not, then who? ....

Patch Set 3:

Andrei, Just to add the background of changes as mentioned in CBQE itself:

Test is deleting the same item on Source and Destination during Bidirectional-XDCR, If deletion is replicated to either end then Memcache client will return "NOT_FOUND" error and this should be handled in the test framework. 

Do you have alternative solution?
