Patch Set 1:

Luca Rhodes, there are still calls to all_docs from `pytests/xdcr/esbasetests.py `. Who is responsible for the XDCR tests? This commit breaks them, but they were probably be broken before, as they requested `_all_docs` which no longer exists.

Those calls aren't trivial to replace, hence I leave it to the XDCR tests maintainer to clean that up. I would merge this change though.
