Line:123, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> by default should be True:
self._default_bucket = self.input.param("default_bucket", True)

Line:136, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> I don't understand the logic, we shouldn't have any dependencies between parameters related to buckets type and their number
