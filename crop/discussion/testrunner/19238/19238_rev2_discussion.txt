Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

as Karan mentioned we should support all buckets:

       if self.default_bucket:
            self.default_bucket_name = "default"
        self.standard_buckets = self.input.param("standard_buckets", 0)
        self.sasl_buckets = self.input.param("sasl_buckets", 0)

see basetestcase
