Line:944, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> Maybe move this in a baseclass/ common class for views.
The below tests for in-memory indexing should be added to more than createdeleteview tests.

Line:947, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> try/catch to catch exceptions in running the command success/not.

Line:954, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> Not a blocker, but please keep lines <80 characters.

Line:955, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> Why `self.ddoc_view_map` and not simply `ddoc_view_map`? Is it really intended to modify the object?

Line:959, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> <80 would be better.

Line:960, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> Why are threads needed?
