Line:40, pytests/cbas/cbas_secondary_indexes.py -> This all code is used in all of the tests. We can move this in setup. If future tests doesn't want to setup cbas then we can govern that using a input param.

Line:611, pytests/cbas/cbas_secondary_indexes.py -> This can be a generic function. I suggest to move this function in cbas_base so that any other cbas component can use it. Also make the dataset as a param to this function so that it can work on any dataset.
