Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:884, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> I think there is too much code for those cases. Load, ddoc ops and verifications are the same (at the start and at the end of test cases) So I think we just can add param like 'ops' = ['warmup', 'delete'] or something like that. And run test case like if ops == 'blabla', then run this action.
