Thanks Luca Rhodes, some comments inline.

Also, I think we should check cwpy into couchbaselabs and make it a dependency (maybe with git submodule, or require git pull) - we do similar things by requiring couchbase-python client.  Having it in couchbaselabs too freezes development at last known working version.

Line:43, pysystests/tests/sample_query.py -> username password via argpargse, although administrator/password can be default when not provided

Line:48, pysystests/tests/sample_query.py -> can get url via argparse

Line:71, pysystests/tests/sample_query.py -> doesn't seem like duration is guaranteed i.e. fast queries or very slow to join I think would skew runtime.  but that may not be requirement

Line:72, pysystests/tests/sample_query.py -> rm spaces and tabs
