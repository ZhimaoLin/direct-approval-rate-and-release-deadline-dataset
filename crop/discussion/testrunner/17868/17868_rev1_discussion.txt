the same region and to the public address otherwise.

I would strongly suggest printing the private ips in the ini  file as well. 

ns_server is goign to use this for mgmt.

[servers]
1:<public_dns>
# private ip

I'm confused.

Could you please explain how commented out private address can help ns_server?

Patch Set 1:

Not help ns_server. I am saying having private ips of these ec2 instances would help debugging and accessing them internally within ec2 vms. 

Infact, in the same zone/region you can add the ec2 vms to ns_server by using private ips.
