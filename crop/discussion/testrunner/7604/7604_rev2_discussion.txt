Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I don't think you should include the library in the tests.  Can't we just check for it at start time?

(also, your commit message says the same thing twice)

Patch Set 2:

this is a work in progress but i am planning on making lot of testrunner specific changes to that library  
e.g :  add more logs , add some redundant verification and maybe even add couchbase-server (capi) stuff there.
