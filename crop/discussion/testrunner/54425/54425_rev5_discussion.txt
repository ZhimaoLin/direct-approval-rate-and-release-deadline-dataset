DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3026 Add ability in testrunner to fail test if erlang/memcached crashed during the run

Specifying -p get-coredumps=True will now additionally-

1. move existing core dumps on servers to a backup folder before a test
2. check for new erlang/breakpad/core dumps after the test and fail the test if found

This works in both standalone and suite runs.
