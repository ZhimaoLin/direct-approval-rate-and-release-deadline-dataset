Patch Set 2:

Overall very impressed by the performance boost here.  I have some comments here based on my experimenting with the patch:

1.  Couldn't get it to work with the BatchDocGenerator.  i.e. I set batch_size to 100 and got errors about calling the .next() function

2. Couldn't get it to work with python sdk.  When I do:  'export testrunner_client=python_sdk', then the test throws some errors

3.  Let's stage for testrunner-ng branch as the decorator module dep will universally break all jenkins jobs...do '  git push origin HEAD:refs/for/testrunner-ng '
