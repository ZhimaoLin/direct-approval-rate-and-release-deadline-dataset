Line:7, lib/couchbase/documentgenerator.py -> will you add support for different value size to kwargs ?

Line:77, lib/couchbase/documentgenerator.py -> didn't understand this ?
            size = size * len(arg)

Line:7, lib/couchbase/documentgenerator.py -> I haven't decided what the best thing is to do yet.

Line:77, lib/couchbase/documentgenerator.py -> This should be size *= len(arg), but my statement is equivalent to that. I will change it.
