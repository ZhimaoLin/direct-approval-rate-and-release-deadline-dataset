Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved

Looks good and I think test code is completely fine.  However when I ran this
the _spatial/_info endpoint didn't have any disk size information, I only received the following:

{"total_rows":0,"rows":[
],
"errors":[
{"from":"http://10.1.2.31:8092/_spatial_merge/","reason":"{badmatch,{not_found,missing_named_index}}"},

If you want to catch for this in the code that may be good as well.

This should work. What you see would be a bug. Can you rerun the test please?
