Line:658, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> looking at logic here, you wouldn't need this section sinceâ€¦
index/2 can be substituted everywhere for expected_num_docs, etc.

Above, you can keep the code where the two expected_num_docs variables may need to be modified based on whether limit is set.   And after this you can add the limit filter to them if necessary:

for q in view.queries:
   q["limit"] = lmit
