DESCRIPTION

Reconnect if disconnected during check for vbucket state

A client may be disconnected at any given time (it could
for instance try to connect to a bucket before it is
enabled and hence get the "no bucket" error and get
disconnected. This is not a fatal error in this function
so we could simply just reconnect and try again.
