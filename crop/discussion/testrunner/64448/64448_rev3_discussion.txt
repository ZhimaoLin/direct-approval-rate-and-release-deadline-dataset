DESCRIPTION

Reconnect if disconnected during check for vbucket state

A client may be disconnected at any given time (it could
for instance try to connect to a bucket before it is
enabled and hence get the "no bucket" error and get
disconnected. This is not a fatal error in this function
so we could simply just reconnect and try again.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

Code is good and I tested and this test passes consistently for me locally. I didn't actually hit the disconnect this time (as I did when I failed verification on this earlier) but the addition of the reconnect() should fix this. 

I'm going to merge as I see this problem is also causing Prerna's failure here: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-19942
