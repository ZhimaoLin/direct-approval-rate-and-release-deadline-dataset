DESCRIPTION

tool to push stats to CBFS

This module works by collecting stats from the seriesly database specified in testcfg.py
and furthermore uses the pandas (python data-anysis) module to store the stats into a dataframe
that is compatibale with version comparisions in the report generator.  Once in-memory as a
dataframe the stats are dumped to a csv file, compressed and pushed to CBFS.
