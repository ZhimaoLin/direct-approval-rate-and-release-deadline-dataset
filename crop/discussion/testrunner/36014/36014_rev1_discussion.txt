Line:1218, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> I think that we should have limitation for printout of num errors. 400 items generate https://friendpaste.com/2FcDw2qDzOE1V3XCLWXYqJ
we don't need to print out all items. developers do not need as much data they need to know in what vbuckets were lost items

Line:728, lib/tasks/task.py -> why so?
the output will be:
Batch 50000 documents done
Batch 50000 documents done
Batch 50000 documents done ?
preferable to see progress, and not part of.

Line:1183, lib/tasks/task.py -> I think that we should have limitation for printout of num errors. for example 1000 errors. if your data will be 1M you might to get min 4M lines only in this block

Line:728, lib/tasks/task.py -> 2014-04-17 22:00:26 | INFO | MainProcess | MainThread | [data_helper.direct_client] creating direct client 10.3.4.176:11210 default

Where we have deleted 300 items? any idea to address to both.
