Line:2436, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> Would it be better to have this done by parameter, else pindex will be backed up for each failure. If there is a parameter, backup can be enabled on a re-run.

Line:3385, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> There is a way to get the install path for CB using diag/eval on cb server. Can you please look at that and have code to generic path rather than hard coded.
