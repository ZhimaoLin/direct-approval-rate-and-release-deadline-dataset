DESCRIPTION

CBQE-4127 : Fix the failing autofailover tests during rebalance caused due to recent changes in Rebalance
Added logic to check if rebalance is in progress during the failure injection time and before checking if auto-failover was initiated. Now we wait for the rebalance to be completed and check if failover was initiated after rebalance has failed due to node failure.
