Line:1748, pytests/fts/stable_topology_fts.py -> This cert only good if cluster has 2 or more nodes.  If it is one node, it should be part of cluster before since cert for new node maps to IP 127.0.0.1

Line:1748, pytests/fts/stable_topology_fts.py -> Good comment, thanks. This test runs in the middle of a suite, with single and multi-node clusters. So it should not affect the cert.
