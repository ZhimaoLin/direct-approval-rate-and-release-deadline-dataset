(6 inline comments)

Thanks Trevor Santana for adding new dataset! some questions, comments inline

Line:2155, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> imports at header

Line:2158, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> Does this work with the append commented out?  If you try to do self.doc_id_map['years'][i] seems like you would get IndexError. since this map is built dynamically.

if so rm comment.

Line:2185, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> Suggesting a CommonDataSet class with this function, as this is also in EmployeeDataSet

Line:2210, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> imports at module header

Line:2236, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> import at module header

Line:2238, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> this variable is being incremented, but I do not see where it's used in stat calculation
