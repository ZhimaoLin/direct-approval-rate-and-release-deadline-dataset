(3 comments)

Line:898, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Please remove the commented out sections.

Line:915, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> here service should be mandatory parameter if we  are writing a generic function to avoid further NonType Exception later

Line:177, lib/tasks/task.py -> Why are there lot of commented out sections? We can revert changes if they don't work.

Line:916, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> camel casing (CapWords convention) is generally used for class names. Class names have first letter in Capitals. This is a naming PEP convention.

Line:916, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Keeping it the same for now as this will require all the function calls change again. Will try to do it in next change.
