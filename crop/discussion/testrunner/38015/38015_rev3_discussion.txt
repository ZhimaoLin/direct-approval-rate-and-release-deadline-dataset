Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

I got the gist of it.  pretty sure it works as advertised.

In testconstants there's some hardcoded urls.  I'm wondering if we can do repo's instead that map to urls.  So from user perspective we may not know what url to use without looking at code.


ie testrunner  -i <ini> -t <test>  -p repo=factory


or repo = latest,  release


at first I thought direct_url meant direct build url but since it points to an entire repo it's safe to assume that none of us will be hosting our own custom repo.

Line:168, lib/builds/build_query.py -> you put these urls in constants, it's better to update code here

Line:168, lib/builds/build_query.py -> Yes.  I plan to do it later.  Since we need to fix the code so windows install script could run now.
