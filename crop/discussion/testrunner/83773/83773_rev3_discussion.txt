Line:13, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> Do you need to inherit this class ?

Line:13, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> Since Couchbase Functions is going to be official name, lets not use the term Eventing. Can you rename the variable, classes, file names etc.

Line:28, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> These would be available through the basetestcase class too, why do you need to initialize them separately ?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:28, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> Yes. couple of lines in the last we can remove. However we would need default_bucket to false, else the basetest would create a default bucket with all the available quota. In functions we would atleast require 3 buckets (source,metadata and destination)
