DESCRIPTION

Deterministic, random-looking get/update key accesses for mcsoda.

This is the new default behavior of mcsoda (also, when random=0).

Nathalie Landry described this formula to generate the next
command's key (for gets and updates) by updating a position...

  position = (position + LARGE_PRIME) % num_items

When num_items is stable, position should visit all the values in
range [0, num_items), as long as LARGE_PRIME and num_items are
relatively prime to each other.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I couldn't find links that would explain why it works. But it does work. I've tested with few num_items values
