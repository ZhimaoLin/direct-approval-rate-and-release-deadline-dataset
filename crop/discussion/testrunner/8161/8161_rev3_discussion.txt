Patch Set 3:

Keith,

can you please verify and merge this change ?
it shouldn't affect most tests since memcached should never take more than 10 seconds to return :) except for those case where flusher is running and expiry pager is cleaning the hash table.
I will be offline for 2 hours and i dont want to block Tony from running failover tests on windows
