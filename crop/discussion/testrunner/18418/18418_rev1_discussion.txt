Line:210, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> minor, should name var 'use_auth' here as in rest of code

Line:214, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Also not critical, but you can toggle which headers to use with a boolean.

headers = (self._create_capi_headers(), self._create_capi_headers_with_auth())[with_auth]

then one http_request line:

â€¦ = self._http_request(api, 'PUT',str(design_doc), headers)

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- I think a better approach would be to add the missing bits for sasl buckets in the core classes, so that things work out-of-the box for the tests.
i.e. there shouldn't be a requirement for each test to maintain list of different type of buckets as required in this approach:

    if self.default_bucket:
        buckets.append(self.default_bucket_name)
    for i in xrange(self.standard_buckets):
        buckets.append("standard_bucket" + str(i))
    for i in xrange(self.sasl_buckets):
        buckets.append("bucket" + str(i))

and then use if checks e.g.
           if "standard_bucket" in bucket or "default" in bucket:

Also, the framework should create sasl buckets with different passwords so its authentication can be tested as well.

I have implemented one such approach here:
