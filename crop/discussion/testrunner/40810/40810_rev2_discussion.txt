DESCRIPTION

Retry bucket creation

When running the test suite on Windows it have sporadic test
failures due to the fact that sometimes the bucket deletion
takes more time than expected.

I believe that we need to improve the bucket deletion code
to correctly monitor when the bucket is completely gone so
that it may be recreated, since this workaround will fail
if the bucket deletion code is really slow.

Line:1529, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> You could write instead:

    for numsleep in range(60, -1, -1):

`range()` is with non-inclusive end, hence you nee to use `-1` if you want to count till numsleep == 0`.

Line:1534, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Please keep lines <80.

Line:1537, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Please note that increment and decrement don't exist in Python. You would need to write `numsleep -= 1`.

Line:1538, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Normally in Python it would be `if not numsleep`, though I find the current way easier to understand.

I would probably put the `if numsleep == 0` at some outer scope as I find less nesting easier to read. It's also easier to keep lines <80 characters this way)
