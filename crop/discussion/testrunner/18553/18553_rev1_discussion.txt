DESCRIPTION

XDCR: Update_delete_patch

This patch lets one add the percentage of items to be updated and
deleted from the set of items (update_% and delete_% to be set in
the .conf file).
Also, included cases for when update and/or delete are called.
Added function in bidirectional-xdcr.py to let two cluster work on
common set of items, to note conflicts.
