Patch Set 2:

few things before you merge.

1- parametrize the ini file ( we already have on checked in to b/resources/dev.ini) instead of echoing it to a file
2- we can use grep for now to detect whether the tests have failed but once KAran merges other changes we should just use the -makefile option
3- parameter for dumping cluster_run output to a file with date timestamp ( similar to how we create a temp folder and copy all logs and results there during a test run )

Patch Set 2:

also let's rename run_tests.sh to something like start_cluster_and_run_tests.sh
otherwisw users will be confused whether they should use testrunnr to run the tests to run_tests ??
