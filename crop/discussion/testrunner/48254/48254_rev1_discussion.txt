Thanks Emerson Duke. comments in line.  also I'm not seeing test for verifying llw case.  or maybe I'm missing something

Line:41, pytests/epengine/lwwepengine.py -> typo: bit of a *hack

Line:48, pytests/epengine/lwwepengine.py -> you should only have to do this once in setup.  as it is now this will run pre-each test.

also, how is it set by xdcr user... via api or enabling xdcr?

Line:83, pytests/epengine/lwwepengine.py -> move to top

Line:175, lib/mc_bin_client.py -> rm

Line:176, lib/mc_bin_client.py -> which memcached command is this 0x8a?  use constant

Line:187, lib/mc_bin_client.py -> It's a little confusing that the constant CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_MODE is different from conflict_resolution_mode arg - what are the differences?

Line:36, pytests/observe/lwwepengine.py -> helper methods here for base class

Line:46, pytests/observe/lwwepengine.py -> rm

Line:112, pytests/observe/lwwepengine.py -> check here is needed that mcd response with support for mutation_seqno feature

Line:139, pytests/observe/lwwepengine.py -> rm

Line:255, pytests/observe/lwwepengine.py -> rm
