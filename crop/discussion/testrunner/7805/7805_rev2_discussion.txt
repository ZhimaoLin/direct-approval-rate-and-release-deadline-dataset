MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:589, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> on a slow system, 2 seconds may not be enough. this should be a poll loop and raise an exception if the timelimit is reached. though there is an exception thrown if no mapping exists for a vbucket, so it may not be needed here.
