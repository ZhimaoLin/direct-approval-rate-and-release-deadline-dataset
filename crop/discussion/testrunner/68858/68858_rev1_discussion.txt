I think we can optimise code cbas_bucket_operations.py

Line:280, pytests/cbas/cbas_base.py -> it should be error/warning level?

Line:317, pytests/cbas/cbas_base.py -> it's better to use the following construction:
if:
elif:
esle
(without nested conditions)

Line:70, pytests/cbas/cbas_bucket_operations.py -> As I see all test methods except this one have common beginning steps:
# Load Couchbase bucket first.
# Create bucket on CBAS
# Create dataset on the CBAS bucket
# Connect to Bucket
it make sense to create common private method and put these 4 steps tehre there
