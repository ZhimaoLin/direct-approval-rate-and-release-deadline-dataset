Line:303, lib/membase/helper/rebalance_helper.py -> can u pass this as args to verify_items_count.

set the default values of these as 3, 2, but not hardcoding as done here.

Line:1065, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> can we use %s instead of format.. slowly moving everything to %s. 

%s is more compatible than format.
