Hi Luca Rhodes,

Can you mention here why you're removing those make rules?

The commit message states the obvious, the we're modifying makefile, but doesn't mention why, neither does jira.
I think that information should be included in the commit log.

Patch Set 1:

Hi Filipe, 

Adding updated info now from the CBQE.

----

Moving out below files as a part of code-cleanup.

- py-views.conf - file does not exist
- py-viewquery.conf - removing this from being a part of Make tests. This test exists on a separate Jenkins job run regularly.
 
Based on discussion w/ dev, it is easier to have a singular set of tests to run before merge changes, and the current makefile contains multiple such tests.
The below tests are removed from the makefile as a part of code-cleanup

@Filipe : if you prefer running view-queries as a part of pre-merge tests, I can include that under the same set of "test-premerge"
