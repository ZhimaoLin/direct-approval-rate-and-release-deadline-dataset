Line:837, pytests/basetestcase.py -> I think it should be "upr" or "tap".
dict["COUCHBASE_REPL_TYPE"]=self.upr

but the name enters into confusion. it's better to use like: repl_type

Line:1826, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> fyi - i'm sure this works, although I feel like sed can do this more efficiently, looks to me like your are taking a preset variable and changing its value.

change:
sed -i file 's/COUCHBASE_REPL_TYPE.*/COUCHBASE_REPL_TYPE = dict[key] /'  

or you can remove it:
sed -i file 's/COUCHBASE_REPL_TYPE.*//' 

or you can grep if it exists before and if not add it
if grep  "COUCHBASE_REPL_TYPE" file
   echo "COUCHBASE_REPL_TYPE=upr" >> file
then

Line:211, pytests/basetestcase.py -> this if isn't really needed right? self.cleanup will get set to False at top of setUP

Line:1826, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> I think set is not set by default in cygwin( not sure)
