Patch Set 6:

Wil fix this

file="/tmp/"+init_file+".bak"+str(datetime.now())

We use  backupfile, 2 lines below
	backupfile=file_path+init_file+".bak"
        sourceFile=file_path+init_file
        o, r = self.execute_command("cp "+sourceFile+" "+backupfile)

Source and Target same on purpose
command="sed -i 's/{0}/{0}".format("ulimit -l unlimited‚Äù)

There is code later which append more information to it, which changes the command

command+=environmentVariables+"/'"+" "+sourceFile
