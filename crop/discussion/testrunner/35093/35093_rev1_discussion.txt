Line:98, pytests/basetestcase.py -> this shouldn't be called here in basetestcase as it will slow down every test since it does remote ssh calls on each setup.  recommend using this in the base of the test suite that needs it.

Line:116, pytests/basetestcase.py -> remove: confusing to force cleanup=True if skip_cleanup is also true.

Line:210, pytests/basetestcase.py -> this logic should be removed.
as it is self.cleanup will usually be false and force unwanted remote shell connections.  Use only in base test of suites that need this.
