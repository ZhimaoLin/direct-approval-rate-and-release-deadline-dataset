Patch Set 5:

I think right now there is no good way to this. 

Either we create wrapper around mc_bin_client for all operations and maintain a golden copy of mc_bin_client, which is in sync with what is shipped with server. 

or do this way. 

Need to make a call here quickly.. direct_client against 2.0 are currently broken.
