Looks good to me by brief looking, a couple of minor comments though.

Please ask Fashid or other QE team member to do deeper review, and please make sure it is clean in your local run before you merge.

Line:180, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> is it a duplicate function from the one above it?

Line:372, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> is this function the same as _async_failover_rebalance() above?  Why do we need two functions doing the same thing?

task.py without changes, better not to change it to uselessness

Line:32, pytests/xdcr-mod/uniXDCR.py -> line is too long ( 80 characters according to QE Coding Guidelines)

Line:47, pytests/xdcr-mod/uniXDCR.py -> from here

Line:58, pytests/xdcr-mod/uniXDCR.py -> to here, this part of code exists in all test funcs, it can be copied/initialized in setUp func.

Line:32, pytests/xdcr-mod/uniXDCR.py -> Done

Line:47, pytests/xdcr-mod/uniXDCR.py -> Yes, moving only the repetitive load part to Setup. The src/dest keys are specific to each testcase and need to be handlede from within the function.
