Line:242, scripts/install.py -> Dont hard code the value here.. use either global params or another file to initialize these values.

Line:245, scripts/install.py -> What ramQuota is the cluster being initialized with?

Line:676, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> Why is this empty?.. are we going to have functionality here?

Line:242, scripts/install.py -> Yeah but I think for one location is ok

Line:245, scripts/install.py -> no ram quota is set here.

Line:676, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> This one is optional for future coding

Line:242, scripts/install.py -> I am adding one file under lib/testConstants.py. The change is under review and should be merged in few hours... 
You can initialize the param there... 
CLUSTER_INITIALIZE_TIMEOUT = 600
