Patch Set 1: Fails; Do not submit

why do we have so many changes in iss files ?
i tried to pull and try out the patch but didn't make any progress.
I think you need to rebase to the top of the tree and update the patch ?

if you have only changed the .py files I can fix things up and upload the new patch
