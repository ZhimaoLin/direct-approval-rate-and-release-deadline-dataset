Patch Set 2:

1. Patch Set1 was uploaded on this review task itself, which has changes in run_job_linux.sh itself to support windows and run as $scripts/run_job_linux.sh "windows". If that looks ok then we can merge Patch Set1.
2. Patch Set2 new script run_job_windows.sh is created that is same as run_job_linux.sh and remove commands e.g. ntp, lscpu etc. which are not supported on windows.
