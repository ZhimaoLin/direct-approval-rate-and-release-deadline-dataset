Line:245, pytests/rackzone/rackzonetests.py -> move to top of method and set type:
type = shell.extract_remote_info().distribution_type

to remove from base

Line:23, pytests/rackzone/rackzone_base.py -> this isn't necessary.
I see that you want machine type for checking in:  _verify_replica_distribution_in_zones

but in that method you open a shell.  so you can get the type when the shell is opened in that method and remove this code (see comments there)

Line:245, pytests/rackzone/rackzonetests.py -> this shell is called after doing rebalance.

Line:23, pytests/rackzone/rackzone_base.py -> I want to mark it fails right at beginning of the test if the os we don't support

Line:245, pytests/rackzone/rackzonetests.py -> it can be in this method, but move up to line 239 for setting os type instead of using self.is_xxxxx

Line:23, pytests/rackzone/rackzone_base.py -> understood, but what other os could there be?  ...that we actually support in enterprise.
