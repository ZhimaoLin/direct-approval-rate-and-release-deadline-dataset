Patch Set 1:

I would suggest not setting the variable name to moxi. Instead set it to client so we can interchange both the vbaware and moxi clients.

It would allow us to do something like the following (in later commit when we verify the robustness of vbaware client.)

if USEPROXY:
  client = MemcachedClientHelper.proxy_client(self.servers[0], self.bucket_name)
else:
  client = MemcachedClientHelper.direct_client(self.servers[0], self.bucket_name)

Patch Set 1:

yeah.

yeah we can pass it as params when running the test and branch the data_load based on these input parameters.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

i think we can have karan clean up the whole data_loader params things after you merge the testrunner and python sdk stuff
