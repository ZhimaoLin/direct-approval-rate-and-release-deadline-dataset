Line:829, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> always print log.info('rebalance percentage : {0} %' .format(avg_percentage)) - when %==100 or % !=100
if instead of elif when avg_percentage == 100 but still running?

Line:835, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> remove this outer else. initial avg_percentage is enough here.

Line:835, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> is not enough, monitor_rebalance fails only when percentage is < 0

ok then how do we detect rebalance is stuck ?

is that in monitor rebalance

Line:829, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> why do we have to care about percentage , if rebalance status is running that means it is still running , we can change this function to return a boolean i guess ?

Line:829, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> no, we are using this function for stopping rebalance when some percentage is reached
