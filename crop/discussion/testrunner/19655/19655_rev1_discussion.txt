DESCRIPTION

CBQE-481 try to solve the memory leak problem for backup test

I add gc.collect() to manually trigger the gc. Also I do a delete
for some object no longer used before the test case finishes. I want to invoke gc more
and ealier.
Because we call gc.collect() severaltimes this might increse the program running time.
