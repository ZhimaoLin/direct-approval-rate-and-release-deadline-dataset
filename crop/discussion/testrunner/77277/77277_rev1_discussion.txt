Line:7, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> Let's not import anything outside 2i directory. Everything that QueryHelperTests has is present in newtuq.py. If not, please add there and this import can be removed.

Line:8, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> This is not used anywhere. If anything needs to be used from this class, please shift that method to base_2i and use.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> newtuq.py does not have everything that is required by the replica testcases, which was added to QueryHelperTests. Making these changes might break something, so I will do it later more carefully.
