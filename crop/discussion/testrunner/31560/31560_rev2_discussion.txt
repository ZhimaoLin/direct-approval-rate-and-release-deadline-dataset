Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:874, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> I think you don't use query in this test, delete it

Line:894, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> self.sleep(60, "Your_message", no need to divide them in two lines

Line:928, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> still this pick a node part and warm up
and final verification part are the same, may be we can create private functions for  them to not to have duplicate code?
