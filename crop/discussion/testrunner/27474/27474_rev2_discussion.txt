DESCRIPTION

CBQE-1409: moving to inernal lbc-python client

this is the first step towards removing external sdkserver.py.
having the kv tasks internal to the work will help to provide
better control over ops and also libcouchbase based clients have
shown to be much better performing than any other smart client
