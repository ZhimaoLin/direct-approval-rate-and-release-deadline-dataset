Line:1192, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> What if I want to set both size and percentage thresholds?

At least latest builds allow to do that.

Line:1192, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> currently, to fix error "Got unsupported fields: databaseFragmentationThreshold and viewFragmentationThreshold" it's correct changes. But with dp5 build methods reset_auto_compaction and set_autoCompaction don't correspond to reality and should be reimplemented fully. for instance, there are cases when it's possible to set db compaction in % and view com. with % and size values, vice versa and so on.

Line:1192, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Oh, I see. We have two duplicate methods and both are broken. Are you going to fix it eventually?
