Patch Set 1:

take a look at logs http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/ubuntu_x64--36_01--XDCR_upgrade-P1/14/consoleFull.

[2013-11-29 21:33:51,834] - [newupgradebasetest:184] INFO - upgrade 10.3.3.240 to version 2.5.0-954-rel is completed
.....

[2013-11-29 21:34:03,208] - [rest_client:38] WARNING - server 10.3.3.218:8091 status is warmup
Exception in thread upgrade_thread10.3.3.240:

    raise e

and then in code 
https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/pytests/newupgradebasetest.py#L186
and https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/pytests/basetestcase.py#L663

we already have timeouts specifically for the case of upgrade
apparently it ceased to operate, we need to investigate why



such timeout as you set in http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/30751/1/lib/membase/api/rest_client.py we can't apply because we could skip errors when the server is unavailable during 30 seconds at normal load. it can only be used after the upgrade cases.
