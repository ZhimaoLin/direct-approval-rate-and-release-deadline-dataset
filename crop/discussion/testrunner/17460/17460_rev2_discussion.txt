Looking good, some comments inline.

Line:110, pytests/view/createviewtests.py -> Passed only if DesignDocCreationException is thrown

Line:125, pytests/view/createviewtests.py -> how about â€¦_same_name_parallel?  since we aren't making threads anymore

Line:139, pytests/view/createviewtests.py -> given name of test, by default this variable should be > 1

Line:141, pytests/view/createviewtests.py -> no need to init with empty arrays since assignments are on next line in the same scope

Line:162, pytests/view/createviewtests.py -> So there's not really an api equivalent to adding a view to a deleted design doc.  
Reason being every time a view is added, ddoc info is also required in the request to the server.  If the ddoc doesn't exist in the request itself cannot be made.

Line:168, pytests/view/createviewtests.py -> I can see this being 2 separate cases that need to do queries:
* complicated map function should allow you do to a basic query without throwing QueryViewException

* not_compiled map function should throw QueryViewException when view is queried

Line:27, pytests/view/createviewtests.py -> default_invalid_view_name_list & long_view_nam is used in one test func, it's not needed to add in setUp
