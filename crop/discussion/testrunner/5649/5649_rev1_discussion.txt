DESCRIPTION

made changes to testrunner for parsing input file

made changes to testrunner for parsing input file

made changes to testrunner to accept only 3 parameters:
-c(or -t) : test cases or the runlist to run
-i : this input file will contain info for each server
for example : IPs,ssh_keys,username,passwrod and etc
-p : key.value way of passing parameters to test cases
for example to pass version number to the version_check test
-p version_number=basestart-21
testrunner parses these values into TestInput object
this object is similar to config object and will be accessible
to all test cases
