DESCRIPTION

refactoring with docid and group query support

Most changes were made to support the following:
Removal of startkey|endkey_docid's tests from simple dataset
and adding to employee dataset where the map functions
produce the kind of data that makes sense to use such filters.
Adding group and group_level filters.
