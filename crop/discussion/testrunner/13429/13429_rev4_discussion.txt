Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

(2 inline comments)

looks good.
just one comment about where the data directory is located

Line:417, scripts/install.py -> is data folder path relative to mongo installation ?
in eperf runs membase is installed under /opt/cochbase but data directory is in a mounted volume ( /mnt/ebs ) 
we can do the same thing for mongo or simply install mongo in /mnt/ebs

Line:424, scripts/install.py -> can you please add a one-line TODO section for decoupling the uninstall function from install.right now you are doing rm -rf as part of the installation and i dont expect us having to uninstall/install mongo but just in case.
