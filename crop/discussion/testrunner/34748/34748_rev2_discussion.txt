Line:9, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> merge conflict

Line:353, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> I guess the test should be failed then?

Line:9, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> oops, sorry will fix.

Line:353, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> No, the problem here is - loading is happening in parallel to rebalance. So load_tasks sees a lot of not_my_vbucket errors during load_task.result() even after rebalance.  Although I tested 3.0 for post rebalance not-my-vbucket errors where I saw none, I'm not sure why I'm seeing them here. I think tasks is now throwing the previously encountered exceptions.

If we fail this test here, all rebalance related tests fail. If we stop the load at this point and proceed with verification, we're good.

Line:353, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> your verification success because:
you start load data then you get MemcachedError and stop loading. our test's kvstore contains only loaded items. so, we check only loaded items.

it does not suit us. we should look for a solution. try to play with params:
batch_size and vb_error(num of retries) from https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py#L854
