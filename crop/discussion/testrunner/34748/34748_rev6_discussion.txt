don't see the reasons to modify py-xdcr-pause-resume.conf? have any reason for this?

Line:293, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> it's better to use elif here

Patch Set 6:

I've increased item count in tests where I need more data to replicate after resume. I've decreased it in cases where there are 3 buckets and we're loading 100K in each bucket. In that case due to bi-dir, merging buckets takes a lot of timeâ€¦so reduced to 50K per bucket. If there's any other change you want me to make I can.
