Patch Set 2:

(2 comments)

Line:28, pytests/fts/random_query_generator/rand_query_gen.py -> this causes no wiki queries to be generated anymore when "all" is passed.

Line:90, pytests/fts/random_query_generator/rand_query_gen.py -> Contrary to the assumption, support for "all" was present and tested before this change. Check Jenkins run on older builds or run this program standalone to verify.

It's best to have all changes reviewed by the original author before merging.
