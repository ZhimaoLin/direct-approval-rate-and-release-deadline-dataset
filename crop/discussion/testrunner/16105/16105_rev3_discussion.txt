DESCRIPTION

CBQE-62: pre-store expected query results

This will allow for better verification and
easier debugging when errors occur  during viewquery tests.

Id's of all docs used in each test are stored into a multi-level
dictionary.  After data is loaded, we create expected result
arrays for each query based on the params that are defined.
