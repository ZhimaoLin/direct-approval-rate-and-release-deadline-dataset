Patch Set 2:

Please don't check in binary files into git version control in future - according to git status this is patch is ~2.8MB in size:

That's 2.8MB you have added to *every* checkout of testrunner *ever* - as git records the complete history of all changes - even if you deleted these files tomorrow they will still exist in the history.

Note further that there's also little point in committing a 51,000 line file into git (queries_subqueries_1000.txt) - that's essentially too large for a human to make any sense of, and even compressed in Git is is ~3.3MB in size.

I assume that file is generated by some code-generation - I suggest you instead check in the script which generates it, and run that to generate the file.
