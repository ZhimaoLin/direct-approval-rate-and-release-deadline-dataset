DESCRIPTION

minor view/testrunner fixes

shouldn't pass limit var as timeout to query_view.

also, give precedence to local lib over system lib.
as the public python sdk also has a couchbase module,
and if this is installed testrunner will not run due to
namespace conflicts.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This should be two commits since you are fixing two separate things. In one you should add the fix for the system append thing and in the other you should delete the limit parameter in the view_results function. Once you split it I will +2 both of them.

Line:18, pytests/viewtests.py -> This line should not be deleted since it isn't part of the change.
