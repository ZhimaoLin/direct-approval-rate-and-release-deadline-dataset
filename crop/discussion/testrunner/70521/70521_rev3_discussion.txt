Line:87, conf/py-cli.conf -> Need to fix in test code that only apply new error if it is from version 4.6.x

Line:60, conf/py-couchbase-cli.conf -> We need to fix in test code.  This fix would fail if it runs in 4.5.x

Line:2538, pytests/clitest/couchbase_clitest.py -> I did fix this by change the condition above from COUCHBASE_FROM_SPOCK TO COUCHBASE_FROM_4DOT6
