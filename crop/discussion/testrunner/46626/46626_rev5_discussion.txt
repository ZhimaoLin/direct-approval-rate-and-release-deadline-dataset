Line:180, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> I don't think a class is necessary to specify this setting. I don't see this class expanding in future either. Pls add as a param in XDCRNewBaseTest class. It can be called check/verify_audit_event.

Also can we have auditing by default? Say
self.check_audit_event = self._input.param("check-audit-event", 1)

Line:440, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> do we need so many single line static methods? Can we instead directly call ValidateAuditEvent.validate_audit_event which can be made static?

Line:1028, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> has this been tested?

Line:180, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> If we keep it as parameter in XDCRNewBaseTest that you need to pass this parameter in each object of CBCluster, XDCRRemoteCluster, XDCRReplication everywhere. Which cause additional effort. Keeping it global-variable will facilitate to add-remove this functionality in better way. 

Why we want to run auditing code always? It will unneccessarily increase time of each job execution (reading audit-log file is time consuming process). Instead of having is True by default, I will rather suggest to have separate conf file for audit validation.

Line:440, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Not really. I created separate functions for better scalability and readability in future.

Line:1028, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Yes.

Ritam's code is not fixed yet. I am giving you the sample run with print statement in "validate_audit_event" function.
