Good set of changes.. Just have few small comments.

Thanks

Line:376, pytests/upgradetests.py -> I think defaults for all these should be True. 
It does not make sense to do upgrades without buckets, or inserting data.. 
it will also reduce the length of conf files..

Line:617, pytests/upgradetests.py -> Can you add a comment why we are looking for r in the initial_version.. Its not obvious...
