Patch Set 2: (5 inline comments)



Line:174, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> Why sleep?

Line:183, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> kv_store passed not used

Line:199, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> kv_store passed not used

Line:20, pytests/basetestcase.py -> We can create another reset method (same as teardown).. and call it here. 

You can take a look at rebalancetests on master.. they do it that way... 

Also take skip-cleanup as input.param incases where we want to skip teardown after the test has failed.

Line:35, pytests/basetestcase.py -> log.info

Line:174, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> Expiration time is 5 so sleep for 5 seconds.

Line:183, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> Will fix.

Line:199, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> Will fix.

Line:20, pytests/basetestcase.py -> I don't think we need a reset method since it will only be called once from here, but I do like the idea of the skip-cleanup param. I will add that.

Line:35, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Should be there.
