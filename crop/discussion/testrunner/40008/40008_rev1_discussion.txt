DESCRIPTION

Fix spatial view query tests

Generating expected docs that match exactly the spatial view
return value is not possible. The reason is that the result is
not ordered in any way, hence a limit can be different, depending
on how the data is shaped.

Hence the expected docs should only take the bounding box into
account, but not any other constraints like skip or limit. This
means that the expected results are a superset of the actually
returned results. Therefore it doesn't make sense to output the
expected number as it will be meaningless and can't be compared
to the actual result.
