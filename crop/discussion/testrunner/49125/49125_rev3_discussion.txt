DESCRIPTION

CBQE:0 Fix Jenkins xdcr job hang
1. Release kvstore lock before terminating a task that failed with an exception so other tasks on same bucket can run without hanging/waiting for release

3. Increase revid verification timeout as 90mins for dgm cases
4. Add dgm tests in filter with full, value eviction
