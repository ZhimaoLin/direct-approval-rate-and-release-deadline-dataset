Patch Set 1: (2 inline comments)

See inline comments

Line:20, lib/couchbase/document.py -> What you return is not JSON (it would be a string), but a Python data structure. I would implement it with __getitem__. You would then directly access the properties (_id, views) from the DesignDocument object.

(This was a copy/paste from an earlier review)

Line:51, lib/couchbase/document.py -> Same as for the DesignDocument class.
