Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:922, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> it is better to make it a parameter taken from conf file, and much more better to make it parameter for all the class, but this can be another ticket

Line:932, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> self.create_views(from basetestcase) will create all views
there is no need in async query, they can be run just self.cluster.query_view

Line:935, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> I guess this will fail because it should fail and test expects num_items to be in results
