DESCRIPTION

BuildQuery class to abstract our build queries

BuildQuery will create MembaseBuild list from Hugo Blankenship page

BuildQuery class expose APIs such as get_latest_builds() or
get_builds_by_version which will parse all the builds listed
in builds.hq... page.It abstract each build into MembaseBuild
and MembaseChange object. MembaseBuild object has properties like
url,version,arch_type and etc so its easier for client to ask for
build with version='v1' arch='x86' and deliverable_type='rpm'
