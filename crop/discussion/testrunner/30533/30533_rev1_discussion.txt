DESCRIPTION

CBST-15: fix for kv_latency stat collection

the new workloader creates a document key_map.
that is instead of putting all keys into ccq
it simply puts the start-end key of a range
whereby the keys can be reconstructed.  therefore
when reading from ccq, we can use just the start key
for checking kv latency
