DESCRIPTION

Tests are aware of new document structure

These test changes are required for this couchdb patch
to pass, as well as making the most obvious mechanical
changes to testrunner to keep the rest of the tests
passing.

http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17590

There are also changes to ns_server. I am putting together a toy build.
