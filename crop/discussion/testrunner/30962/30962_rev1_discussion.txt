some q's inline

Line:314, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> may also want to pass in mv_logs dir from ini?

Line:321, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> will there be a case for preserving old logs? or is this done at startup

Line:772, pytests/basetestcase.py -> this will mean we cannot change log_level without changing location.  is that the desired behavior?

Line:314, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> Will do.

Line:321, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> This is done at startup, so the old logs contain only the pre-cluster state of the nodes. Can add, but imo not necessary for the current tests.

Line:772, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Nopes, Can add that. Did not since, this was for a specific customer usecase and I wanted to reduce the stop/start couchbase on each node. 

Will separate this out for more generic availability.
