DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0: Support node removal, fix configs for negative case, print failures in queries

- Added reset_services parameter to remove all services
- Removed negative test cases from conf in recovery test cases
- Made sure we do not pick always master node as n1ql node
- Added logic to make sure that when we pick master node as target
during recovery tests it works, currently it fails
- Added logging during failure of aync n1ql querying
- Fixed logic to try only once during querying
- Remove running of cbq-engine as we use rest api always
