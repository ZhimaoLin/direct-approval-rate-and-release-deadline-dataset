(6 comments)

Line:283, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> Thread is not needed here, it should be like tasks = self._async_rebalance_in() and [task.result() for task in tasks]

Same for below. cases also.

Line:584, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Logic inside if and else is same, so please short this function. e.g. def _async_rebalance_out(self, cluster="source"/"destination"):

Same for rebalance_in and swap_rebalance. We can handle the exceptions also in good manner. 

Please replace the code in rebalanceXDCR.py also with new fuctions.

Line:594, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> this line will make function synchronous. Please return tasks from here. So threading will not be needed in the test itself.

Line:610, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Logic is same in if and else function. Please make it only once.

Line:619, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Same as above.

Line:643, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> same as it make function synchronous. Please return tasks.

Line:283, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> Got it, saw your comment in the other file.

Line:584, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> I agree we have to do this refactoring to remove duplicated code, but I'm afraid we're shifting focus from testing Pause-Resume to refactoring xdcr tests. 

IMHO, we should not change rebalanceXDCR.py before signing off this feature.

Line:594, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Now I see why you said threading is not needed. I'll add this.

Line:610, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> ok

Line:584, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Agreed with Aruna.
we need to share the new implementation and code refactoring(if significant changes are required). besides refactoring of pause/resume XDCR  has been performed many times(maybe it's not the latest version :)  ). we should not involve old cases here.
