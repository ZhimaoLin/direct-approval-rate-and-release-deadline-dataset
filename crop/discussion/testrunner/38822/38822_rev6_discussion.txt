Line:180, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> we don't need to handle "if self.deltaRecoveryBuckets" if we have only rest.rebalance(), we can use the same method
self.rest.rebalance(otpNodes=[node.id for node in self.nodes
],ejectedNodes=[],deltaRecoveryBuckets = self.deltaRecoveryBuckets)

Line:198, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> the same

Line:376, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> not to add logic param, you can check self.assertFalse(summary, summary)

Line:1100, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> I believe that we should add this implementation in rebalance() method because ns_server uses the same API for rebalance with/out deltaRecoveryBuckets. so, we also should pass deltaRecoveryBuckets=[] in controller/rebalance by default

Line:39, conf/py-newfailover.conf -> could we aply diff values for all params: replicas, num_failed_nodes, items, add sasl bucket/don't use default, etc
