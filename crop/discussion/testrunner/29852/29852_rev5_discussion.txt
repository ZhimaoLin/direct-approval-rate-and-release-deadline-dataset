Line:156, pytests/clitest/collectinfotest.py -> Please keep the original code. Remove try and finally.

Line:164, pytests/clitest/collectinfotest.py -> Test case doesn't ask not to use right reduce_func. Please simplfy the logic, like below:

reduce_func ="__count"
if self.generate_map_reduce_error:
     reduce_func="__wrong_func"

view = View(...., map_func, reduce_func)
self.cluster.query_view(..., view.name, ...).
executed_cb_collect.....

Line:169, pytests/clitest/collectinfotest.py -> where "views" used?

Line:11, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> This file should not be part of this review. Use git checkout <file> command to keep file same as in repository.

Line:169, pytests/clitest/collectinfotest.py -> why do you use QueryView object and not View from document.py? QueryView is designed and used only for viewquery class

Line:173, pytests/clitest/collectinfotest.py -> do not hardcode names, especially view_name
