(6 comments)

Line:122, pytests/clitest/collectinfotest.py -> actually, useless check, because it checks for all files in LOG_FILE_NAME_LIST and there is no need to check again one particular file

Line:182, pytests/clitest/collectinfotest.py -> node_down is not used

Line:184, pytests/clitest/collectinfotest.py -> self.shell already created in parent setup()

Line:185, pytests/clitest/collectinfotest.py -> if you are not using output and error -just delete them

Line:11, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> Do we need this file in commit?

Line:479, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> no need in \ in comments
