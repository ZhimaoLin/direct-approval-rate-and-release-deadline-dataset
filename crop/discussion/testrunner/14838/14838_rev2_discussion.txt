I also don't really like the idea of the monitor. All if does if call the get_result() function and this is something that I think the user should be doing.

Line:30, lib/tasks/taskhelper.py -> Rebalance in and out are duplicates of the rebalance task

The reason I like monitor there is it keeps me from having to be the task manager in my test code.  Yes it just calls set result, but it helps reduce common patterns of schedule+call result.

I understand what you want, but I don't think this is the right way to go about it. We can have sync and async tasks, but I think this should be done differently. Let's discuss offline.

Line:30, lib/tasks/taskhelper.py -> These are duplicate functions though. You can achieve the exact same thing by calling rebalance.

Patch Set 2:

I know this is in another change set, but I disagree with having a monitor parameter in each function and Luca Rhodes needs the functions in this commit so that she can be unblocked.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:30, lib/tasks/taskhelper.py -> these are two helpers for commonly used tasks in testrunner. Single rebalance doesn't doe incremental rebalance ...ie add/remove and wait with delay before next rebalance
