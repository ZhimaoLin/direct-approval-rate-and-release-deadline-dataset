Line:8, pytests/transfer/transfer_base.py -> Why do u need login_info?

You can read this from the ini file

Line:10, pytests/transfer/recoverBraylon Arnoldsetransfer.py -> This should be after calling super

Line:26, pytests/transfer/recoverBraylon Arnoldsetransfer.py -> why do we need this variable?

Line:41, pytests/transfer/recoverBraylon Arnoldsetransfer.py -> You can reduce one for loop and initialize bucket_names in the same for loop

Line:49, pytests/transfer/recoverBraylon Arnoldsetransfer.py -> you can merge these 2 for loops
