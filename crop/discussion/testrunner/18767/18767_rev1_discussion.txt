Patch Set 1: (6 inline comments)

can you create temporary project within couchbaselabs?

even "cbd-461" (whatever, just don't call it cbmon).

Line:15, pytests/performance/features/stats.feature -> like whatever?

Line:19, pytests/performance/features/stats.feature -> what is document?

Line:29, pytests/performance/features/stats.feature -> reasonable?

Line:47, pytests/performance/features/stats.feature -> Feature: ability to dynamically drill-down into data like google finance

duplicate?

Line:49, pytests/performance/features/stats.feature -> without any changes?

Line:55, pytests/performance/features/stats.feature -> should we support OS/2?
