Patch Set 1:

For this test we are only loading on master and then rebalancing noodes in.

So its only master for this ep stats check.
It would be good to have the check for all nodes, but would be a different checkin

Patch Set 1:

yes but after you rebalance in new nodes items are relocated to those new nodes and we need to wait for items to get persisted on those new servers as well

I am going to add stat check across cluster as a separate commit. This one is just placing the check at the right place.
