Patch Set 1:

The check function in CreateViewTask doesn't have a sleep before retrying. So in cases where its taking a little long for view to be ready or in negative cases where check would eventually timeout, its just printing a lot of messages. After this change it would check after every 2 seconds. This is as discussed with Tommie and Andrei.

Line:563, lib/tasks/task.py -> delay between retry so as to not spam server when failingâ€¦also helps reduce log size
