DESCRIPTION

MB-17420: Make cleanup call more flexible

The call to cleanup data from ns_server is using the build system.
It expected that the build command is a simple command without
additional arguments (e.g. `make` or `nmake`). As you can build
Couchbase on Windows also with Ninja instead on NMake, the appropriate
command is `cmake --build ..\..\build --target`. This commit makes
it possible to use such more complex make commands.
