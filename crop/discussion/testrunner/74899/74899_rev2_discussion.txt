DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3980: [5.0.0 QE Sanity] Autofailover test autofailovertests.AutoFailoverTests.test_30s_timeout_stop takes ~25 mins
Reduced the number of items loaded in the tests to 1000 from 1000000 to reduce the test time. Loading of data was taking long time and hence the test was running for nearly 25 min.
