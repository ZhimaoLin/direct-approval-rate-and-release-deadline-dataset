DESCRIPTION

CBQE-1183 Eliminate hard coded ip address when set up a cluster in json file

We only mention the ip address in testcfg.py.
The phase definition can be:
                "0" :
                {
                    "name" : "set_up_cluster",
                    "desc" :  "rebalance in all nodes",
                    "cluster": {"initial_nodes": "4"}
                },

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Great feature, and can you also incorporate the 
 ClusterStatus class from app.workload_manager into this?  Note it runs in the background and keeps state of all active nodes in the cluster. This way if initial_nodes is set but no list is specified in the testcfg things will still work.
