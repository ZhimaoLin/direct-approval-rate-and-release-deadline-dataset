Line:643, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> does nodes[0] is master node. please use master_node in passed in __async_rebalance_out_cluster...() function.

Line:686, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Couldn't get signification of this change now. self.cluster.failover was also doing the same. Please call self._get_active_replica_count...() here itself.

Line:1332, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Please refer my comment in pathset-2. metadata verification is in finally() clause of verify_results()

Line:1373, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> mm, this is already done in another commit. Please update the repository.

Line:643, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> it doesn't matter which node it is. this is just to get an idea of whether loading is happening at the time of failover.

Line:686, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> self.cluster.methods need not be called from multiple places. It's better if maintained in one method so changes can be made more easily.

Line:1332, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> yes I know that but pls note that this method is called independently in so many places outside of verify_results. Pls lets not argue about this. We dont need to throw an exception.

Line:1373, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Done

Line:643, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> how we will ensure that loading is happening?

Line:645, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> No need for this log statement, you have already put log statement for graceful in task.py.

Line:686, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> I believe this change is done for debugging a particular test case, not for all failover tests? In that case only that particular tests needs to be changed rather this API.

Line:1332, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> If this method is called independently then this change may mask many errors, thats why I gave suggestion to have new parameter for the function "throw_error=False/True".

I think think there should be another function which prints missing keys and called here if verification count fails for better solution.
