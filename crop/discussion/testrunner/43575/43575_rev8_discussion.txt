Line:1329, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> This is not the first time I'm pointing out that I don't see a single case where an exception should be thrown. Why waste time arguing on this point? If there are cases that need this exception, I need you to point those to me and not make patches incorporating your comments on my patches.
