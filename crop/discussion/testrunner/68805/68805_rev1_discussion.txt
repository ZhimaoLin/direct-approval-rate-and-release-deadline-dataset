Line:47, pytests/tuqquery/date_time_functions.py -> do we need Class in class name? can't it just be DatetimeFunction

Line:54, pytests/tuqquery/date_time_functions.py -> is this needed? if not, please remove

Line:87, pytests/tuqquery/date_time_functions.py -> please have a function to form this dictionary when time_tuple is passed.. repetitive code used above.. will be useful if you add more functions laters
