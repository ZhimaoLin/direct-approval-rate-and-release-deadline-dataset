Line:1005, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> shell disconnect should be in finally. If there will be an exception it won't disconnect

Line:1007, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> how do you handle if there is any exception in thread? currently thread just will be stopped, main thread don't know anything about child thread' exceptions

Line:1013, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> for cluster run this won't work, port also has to be parametrized

Line:1015, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> shell disconnect has to be in finally block
