Line:63, pytests/clitest/epctltest.py -> mc_conn.close()

Line:86, pytests/clitest/epctltest.py -> better to move self._load_all_buckets in if block, but in general it's a bad practice in the same method in one place to return something, the other is not

Line:34, pytests/clitest/cbstatstest.py -> if len(error) or output[1].find("Error") != -1:
 raise..
elseif:
  raise..

Line:63, pytests/clitest/cli_base.py -> I see you can not add index variable and use coloncount

Line:66, pytests/clitest/cli_base.py -> can we replace the expression like stats[0].strip() + ":" + stats[1].strip()... on "".join(line.split())

Line:86, pytests/clitest/epctltest.py -> Completely agreed its a bad practice, but it is a conflict of code repetition as we need synchronous load for only one case and for rest it will be asynch method

Line:63, pytests/clitest/cli_base.py -> did'nt get properly what you are trying to say, i mean how we can improve this

Line:66, pytests/clitest/cli_base.py -> yes we can
