Line:86, pytests/clitest/epctltest.py -> self.param_value = 1000000 by default. sleep in 60000000 sec?

Line:97, pytests/clitest/epctltest.py -> self.fail()

I think -1 does not justify the given comments

Line:86, pytests/clitest/epctltest.py -> :) No it wont behave like that, this sleep statement gets executed only when parameter is alog_sleep_time and in that case we do not have any realistic case in which we can make param_value=10000000.....

Line:97, pytests/clitest/epctltest.py -> When we write if else statement sometimes we get into situation where just to complete logic of else we write log info, although in this case this statement will never get executed moreover it is just completion of logic and as well as we have defined cases so this statement will never get executed so there is no logic to make test fail.
