I don't think that failover and autofailover tests require any  changes/improvements

http://qa.hq.northscale.net/job/win_2008_x64--14_03--failover-P0/26/ PO on windows
http://qa.hq.northscale.net/job/centos_x64--27_01--failover-P1/11/ P1 failover + autofailover

all tests passed against 2.5.1

Line:15, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> super(FailoverTests, self).setUp(self) already failed if servers are not started

Line:18, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> FailoverBaseTest.tearDown has RemoteUtilHelper.common_basic_setup(self.servers) that do all needed preparations

Line:53, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> I fixed it in https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/commit/c76a83a9fb839641444eff8dcd17f51868ad1863

do you have failed runs with the fixes? then please provide link on jenkins with failures.

Line:150, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> tearDown started from self.start_servers(self.servers)
