what is the purpose of this index?

Line:2416, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> Yes, the stmt has 2 selects and 2 indexscans.

Need to check 2 indexes on each indiv stmt and this create index2 satisfies the 2nd stmt.

Line:2435, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> It should, but this has worked on the earlier test and I dont want to change the format for 1 test only.

I plan to modify all if I change the format on any one.
