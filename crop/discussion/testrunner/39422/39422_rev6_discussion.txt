Patch Set 6:

I think we shouldn't add the same tests/scenarious but with bucket_priority priority. it's better to extend some existed tests and aslo don't use the same params for all tests:
standard_buckets=2,s
asl_buckets=2,standard_bucket_priority=low:high,sasl_bucket_priority=low:high

Patch Set 6:

The idea behind using the same type of bucket priority is to keep a consistent model. I kept it simple - just to check the impact of priority on rebalance and failover scenarios. Added parameters only for changing priority so that we can compare tests and know what is the difference when priority is the same. Of course, we can extend, will have to think. 

Please do add your rating to this review.
