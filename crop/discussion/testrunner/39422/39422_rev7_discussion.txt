Patch Set 7:

Hi Parag,

"I kept it simple - just to check the impact of priority on rebalance and failover scenarios." I think that bucket priority shouldn't affect on rebalance? or not? I believe that we should not increase the set of tests and their duration.

"Added parameters only for changing priority so that we can compare tests and know what is the difference when priority is the same. Of course, we can extend, will have to think." - it sounds weird. do you try to check behaviour only for such configuration "standard_buckets=2
,sasl_buckets=2,standard_bucket_priority=low:high,sasl_bucket_priority=low:high"?
