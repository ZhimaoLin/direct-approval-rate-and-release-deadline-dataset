Line:43, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> what is the use of count?

Line:66, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> can we use %s here as well

Line:234, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> somehow hardcoding 10000 does not look good here.
maybe this could be input param items?

Line:250, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> Can you add alog_sleep_time to the log message here
