Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

we need to find a better way of parametrizing these things. having a global variable really doesn't make sense to me.

Patch Set 2:

Well there are two variables here..
1) Specific to test, which like here can be declared globally inside in the file only
2) Test wide globals, for which we have testconstants. (NS_SERVER_TIMEOUTS etc)
