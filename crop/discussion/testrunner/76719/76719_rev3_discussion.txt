Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:220, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_tokens.py -> why load all sample_buckets if test is specific to beer-sample?

Line:276, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_tokens.py -> why is there a run_cbq_query() here? It goes back to why this class does not inherit QueryTests class?

Line:276, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_tokens.py -> Removing run_cbq_query and inheriting from QueryTests.This class was created only for tokens test and there was no need of inheriting query tests class initially.
