Line:638, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> may be we can add some timeout here? For cases when it will fail and queue size will not become 0.

In general i think it's better to fix test regarding CBQE-1695: ie make sure that the check is not started in less than 30 seconds after the uplooad date

Line:638, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> I agree, every wait_for method should have default timeot and additional param if test requires any special time

Line:640, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> if you have n buckets you will get 15*n unnecessary delays

I agree with Trevor Santana and Andrei. We need a timeout. And we do not need to poll each bucket for 15 seconds, probably a better way is to check all buckets every 15 seconds.
