DESCRIPTION

Added a load generator for testing xdcr replication/conflicts

This load generator keeps a client side list of all of the key that
are stored in the clusters. It has the ability to do create, update,
and delete to a node in a given cluster. It also allows the test
writer to verify that the keys and values match on all of the
clusters.
