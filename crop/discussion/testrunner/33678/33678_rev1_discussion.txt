cool - just minor cleanups.   Also it's not clear the context in which this script is to be run.
i.e. after cbtransfer has occurred, and/or views have been created with all docs indexed.

Is src and target data transferred from different nodes?

Line:16, scripts/compare_cb_docs.py -> *taken

Line:25, scripts/compare_cb_docs.py -> cbt - is what parser checks for

Line:56, scripts/compare_cb_docs.py -> rm whitespace

Line:122, scripts/compare_cb_docs.py -> fyi you can also do set notation subtraction
diff1 = s1 - s2

Line:166, scripts/compare_cb_docs.py -> cleanup all the ws

-------------------------------------
