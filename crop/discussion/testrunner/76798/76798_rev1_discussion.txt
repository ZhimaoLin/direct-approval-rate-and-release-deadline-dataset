Line:54, conf/fts/py-fts-querytime-tests.conf -> The test tries to sort on a field"invalid" that's not present in any of the documents. You mentioned that in such cases, the docs can get highest or lowest values. Hence removing the expectation of the sorted order of results - expected=emp10000071,emp10000001,emp10000042. "Tolerance" relaxes the order of documents specified under it, usually the ones with the same score.

Line:54, conf/fts/py-fts-querytime-tests.conf -> ok, that in that case, in the commit message you said "scoring test", did you mean "sorting test"
