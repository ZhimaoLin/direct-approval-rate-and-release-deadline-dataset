Line:520, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> RestException instead?

Line:1350, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Is the missing 'l' intentional?

Line:1576, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> meant < or > ?

Line:1577, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> mean <> ?

Line:1579, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> would  C1 <> C2 <> C3 <> C1 also be considered hybrid?

Line:1583, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> < is also possible, "token" is a generic name, I think it would be a list like [C1, >, C2, <>, C3..] right? This is where adding a comment above the method helps to make code reading easier.

Line:1593, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> If topology = C1<C2 <>C3>C4, this would end up pairing C1 > C2. What's source and what's destination would totally depend on the symbol connecting C1, C2 etc.

Line:1656, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> This method would very soon accept filter expression as an argument. With filters in xdcr, we would have to merge buckets based on filter expression. Say we have 1000 items in C1, C1 > C2 and filter all keys ending with 0, dest bucket would only have 100 keys. I can implement this, this is just heads up.
