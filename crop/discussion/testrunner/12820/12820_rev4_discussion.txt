DESCRIPTION

Make waiting for persistence more robust

It seems that RebalanceHelper.wait_for_mc_stats_all_nodes()
works better than RebalanceHelper.wait_for_stats() when you
want to make sure the data really got presisted.

Makes the spatial view test
(spatialviewtests.SpatialViewTests.test_insert_15k_update_100_docs)
pass.
