DESCRIPTION

Make waiting for persistence more robust

It seems that RebalanceHelper.wait_for_mc_stats_all_nodes()
works better than RebalanceHelper.wait_for_stats() when you
want to make sure the data really got presisted.

Makes the spatial view test
(spatialviewtests.SpatialViewTests.test_insert_15k_update_100_docs)
pass.

Line:136, lib/membase/helper/spatial_helper.py -> this one is also required now. ( due to a bug we found in ep-engine last week ) 
RebalanceHelper.wait_for_mc_stats_all_nodes(master, bucket, 'ep_uncommitted_items', 0)
