Line:384, scripts/install.py -> bad examples :) 
1)don't you see erlang_threads = params.get('erlang_threads', testconstants.NUM_ERLANG_THREADS)? 
2)in erlang_gc_level = params.get('erlang_gc_level', None)  None is never used as well.  + then 'if erlang_gc_level is None' is useless

Line:385, scripts/install.py -> and the fact that I do not see that there
