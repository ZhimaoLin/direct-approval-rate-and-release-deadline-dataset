Line:26, scripts/tapdump.py -> the comment is "split by comma" but there is no comma splitting here. in addition what is the expected format of params["vbuckets"], all this string manipulation seems odd.

vbuckets=[int(vbucket) for vbucket in params["vbuckets"].split(",")]

Line:26, scripts/tapdump.py -> yeah since we are passing the key,value pairs as params to the test i couldn't use the "," and instead opted out for "."

suggestions welcome for passing vbuckets in a list or even vbucket range?
