Line:2133, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> We should never return 0 if thats not what the api returns. Raising an exception is fine.
Also, here json_parsed is undefined in case the rest call fails. That will lead to an exception.

Line:647, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> We are tNathalie Landrying about 3 levels of nesting here. Would it be right to just say the index definition is not present? Especially given where this is called. Even after yesterday's changes to populate_node_partition_map(), is there a need for this?

Line:2133, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> 0 is returned because in your code you check if index count is 0 or not .json_parsed is not undefined, defined at top of method.

Line:647, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> ok , i am reverting this, will be reverted in the patch .

Line:2131, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> instead, just do else. If error was returned, status is false.

Line:2133, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> "..in your code you check if index count is 0 or not" --> where? Returning zero could mean the api returned zero. If you intend to handle the "not status" case as exception, thats fine.
