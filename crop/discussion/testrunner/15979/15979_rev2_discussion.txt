Patch Set 2:

number of vbuckets is readable from the cluster by calling rest.get_vbuckets(bucket).vbuckets so i think we should not hardcode that and instead read the value from ns-server

Patch Set 2:

@Zackery Barr, in setupBase1(), it does get from self.rest.get_vbuckets, I just add that to enforce it gets defaults instead of 0.
