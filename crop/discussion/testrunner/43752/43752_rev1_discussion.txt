Patch Set 1:

cbtransfer doesn't succeed running since the remote util implementation fails to run. Found the same issue with cbbackup. This can be a VM issue but found the issue on all VMs. When trying to run cmd /c "C:\Program\ Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbtransfer.exe", it cannot find "C:\Program". This change is to avoid this code path. Have checked manually cbtransfer works on windows though, for the same command.
