Line:1, pytests/management/bucketops/singlenode/create/createtests.py -> test case :
create bucket less than minimu allowed < 100 MB
- max ram size : get_nodes()
- default on 112111 wth sasl password
- same test cases with different number of replicas ( one replica )
0,1,2,3
negative for more than 3 or
less than 0
- create bucket with special chars like !.?....
- max number of characters ?
- negative : more than max number of characters
- i18n tests for bucket creation

-divide RAM/100 mb 
- negative tests (divide RAM/100 mb)+1

added these tests to
http://techzone.couchbase.com/wiki/display/membase/Bucket+Operations

Line:11, pytests/management/bucketops/singlenode/create/createtests.py -> same tests for memcached buckets

Line:13, pytests/management/bucketops/singlenode/create/createtests.py -> set RAM lower - 100

Line:70, pytests/management/bucketops/singlenode/create/createtests.py -> extra level of verification - think about it 
expected behavior for this test
