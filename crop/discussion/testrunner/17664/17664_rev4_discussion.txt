Patch Set 4: Do not submit

Why are these new tests inside py-newrebalance.conf if they do queries as well?

I would prefer them to be part of py-viewquery.conf or any of the the other view related testsuites.

Those are the ones I run daily, and it already takes more than 2 hours to run them. If they remain in this test suite, or people start adding view related tests to other test suites, chances are I won't notice that and will not run them before doing changes in the view engine, not to mention the amount of time.

Filipe, I've added the same tests with a smaller data in our basic conf for view queries. Now we work with the creation tests for basic features(queries, view ops, rebalance, etc...) some tests can almost the similar for these areas/suites( can be crossed). For instance for view ops(create/delete/update) we also have cases with view queries.

Patch Set 4: No score

Ok, thanks Andrei.
That makes it easier for me, as the view test suites are the only ones I run on a daily basis locally.

Line:102, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> these two loops are repeated 3 times, may be we can create a function?
