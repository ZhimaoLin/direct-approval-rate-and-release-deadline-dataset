Line:97, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> I see htat you are sometimes using 120 and sometimes 60.. any logic behind it?... 
if not.. u can use a global param for it as well.

Line:21, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Why do we need another param for 
default_bucket_name?

if default_bucket == true.. then default_bucket_name = default

Line:100, pytests/rebalance/rebalanceout.py -> is this a blocking call?
If yes. you are not doing it "concurrently"

Line:100, pytests/rebalance/rebalanceout.py -> here, I am convinced that the queries give the expected result (execute until the indexing is completed in parallel - all results will be obtained)
