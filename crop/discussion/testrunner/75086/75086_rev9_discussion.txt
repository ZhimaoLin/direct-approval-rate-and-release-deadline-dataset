DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3984: reduce HTP memory usage

Merging of kv-store could lead to up to
4x memory usage while child-processes are
copying their kv-stores into the kv-store
of the main process.
This is problematic for tests loading +100k items.

The solution here is to not give each child process
it's own copy of the entire kv_store,
but allow the process to create a tmp_store
which get's merged later so that there is no overhead
