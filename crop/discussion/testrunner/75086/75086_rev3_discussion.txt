DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3984: reduce HTP memory usage

Merging of kv-store could lead to up to 4x memory usage while child-processes are copying their kv-stores into the kv-store of the main process.  This is problematic for tests loading +100k items.

The solution here is to not give each child process it's own copy of the entire kv_store, but allow the process to create a tmp_store which get's merged later so that there is no overhead
