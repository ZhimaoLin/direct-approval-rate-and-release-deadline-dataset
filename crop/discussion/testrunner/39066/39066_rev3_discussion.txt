Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:2218, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> my opinion:
if controller/startLogsCollection is a public API then this method should take any set of parameters. So, we don't have to handle a set of params before request; response(status, content) should be checked in the tests(in negative cases, for example)

Line:2233, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> it's better to return None if there is no active collect_log task
