Line:1318, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> Lets not hard code the paths.. derive it from ns server config. This is to ensure these tests work on a non-root installation, or a windows/mac installation as well. This comment applies to all instances of hard coded paths in the file.

Line:1495, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> Since this param is used multiple times, it is better if it is read from input params in the base test class' setup method, and refer to the value each time. This applies for all such input params read across the file.
