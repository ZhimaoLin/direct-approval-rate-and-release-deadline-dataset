(2 comments)

Line:676, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> Can we name the method better ? (remove final). Same applies to the methods below. Also similar feedback for the file name.

Line:676, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> Since the testcases are long, it would be great if you can summarize the steps performed in the testcase as comments. Applies to all testcases. It would be easier to review after that
