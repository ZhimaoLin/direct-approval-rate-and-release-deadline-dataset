DESCRIPTION

MB-5461: XDCR: changes_feed REST API no longer valid

Today changes_feed REST API is used by XDCR unit tests for the
verification purpose to compare deleted items in the source and
target clusters. This API is no longer used and we use a different
way to verify deleted items from storage in unit tests.
