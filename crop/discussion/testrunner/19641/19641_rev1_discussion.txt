Andrei,

the commit message says this is a fix for compaction but then i see in the description and in the code that you also fixed dev views -> production issues. ( this is something i think i asked Trevor Santana/Deep so that you can spend time doing manual testing for cisco as we spoke ).
i understand its easier to have them in one change but thats not the right thing to do given that this impact literally every single view tests and some xdcr tests.

please break this to two pieces and have it as two patches.

i also noticed that you are fixing the formatting for function params - those changes again can be part of another commit where the commit message says "reformatting"
