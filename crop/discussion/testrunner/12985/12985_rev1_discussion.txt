DESCRIPTION

Move functions to get parameters into the TestInput class

Getting parameters is a general use case and should not
only be part of the MapReduce View test base class, but
available for all tests.

Patch Set 1:

I've tested it only with running those tests:
viewtests.ViewBasicTests:
    test_view_on_x_docs,num-docs=100
    test_view_on_x_docs,num-docs=1000
    test_view_on_x_docs,num-docs=10000

But I made sure the logs tell me that the correct number of docs was picked up. As it was a search and replace job we should be good. Though it would be cool if you could run the full suite to verify this commit.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

looks good to me
TestInput class isn't written nicely at all and needs lot of improvements on it by adding more helper and static methods.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Its a good change. 
But, I think this might break eperf... I had added parami, paramf and param functions especially for eperf.. But now it seems to make sense of every other thing.. 

Can keith verify this change set with eperf.. 
 eperf makes use of this functionality heavily. So, might have to change eperf... 

After this is verified we can push it in..
