Line:1958, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> Please check if this string is constant or induced inadvertently.

Line:1001, pytests/basetestcase.py -> This is redundant, you can just use 'data_path' as it is.

Line:1023, pytests/basetestcase.py -> We discussed this for more code clarity, please rename the params or variables to current_dataset and previous_dataset.
