Some notes: This is a fairly large change.  I'm ok with breaking into smaller commits, but this helps with grasping the full body of what is needed to run compaction task from start to finish including sample test.

In MonitorViewFragmentationTask there are static methods that I plan to move out of this class into a view_helper module.
