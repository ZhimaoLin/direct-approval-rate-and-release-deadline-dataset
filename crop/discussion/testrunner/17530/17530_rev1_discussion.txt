Very nice change-set. Much needed here.

Line:926, pytests/xdcr.py -> why do we need this for loop?

Line:926, pytests/xdcr.py -> This is existent code. Looks like not very efficient since we just need to remove the evicted node from rebalance_server_a.  I think it is ok to leave the code here.

I will merge this commit. Be free create another commit to fix it.
