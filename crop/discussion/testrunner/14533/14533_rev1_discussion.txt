Patch Set 1:

With bidirectional replication, the overlapping data's final values (after conflict resolution on both sides) is not predetermined because some one side may be the winner for some keys while the other side will be the winner for the rest of the keys.

The idea of populating ClientKeyValueStore() during gets is that we execute it on both clusters (after replication is completed) and compare the values to ensure that they all match.

Make sense?
