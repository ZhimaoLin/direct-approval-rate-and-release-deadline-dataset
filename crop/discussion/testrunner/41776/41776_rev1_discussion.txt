File Comment: conf/py-uitests.conf -> is there any specific reason why they should? Asking because TestInput parses messages with whitespaces as expected, the hole error is in variable. If I add quotes parser with think that error contains quotes.

File Comment: conf/py-uitests.conf -> Ok you are right, I was facing some issue while parsing a error message but later realized it's because it contains single quote that's why it got parsed only when passed in quotes.
