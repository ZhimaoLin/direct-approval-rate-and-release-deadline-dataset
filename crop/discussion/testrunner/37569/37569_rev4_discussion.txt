Patch Set 4: Code-Review-2

Andrei, the upr and vbucket control in basetestclass is given to control per test changing them per test case. Please do not remove them.

Hi Parag, please provide tests/cases where they are used or any scenario where it could be useful? 

See my research on their usage https://friendpaste.com/1OqCdGI02ZZbsrJFZQzxSO

btw, it's your commit and you can modify it as you see fit :)

looking at install.py is the intent to enable upr by default?  (it is already today).

I think we need a different patch where we check for setting upr='false' or having ways to recognize disabling.

Line:450, scripts/install.py -> the use case for this check may not be needed:
-p upr=none,

results in upr = None, and today means upr will be enabled.

Line:455, scripts/install.py -> same as above

Line:450, scripts/install.py -> right, but my approach is:
None - no changes
true - set upr with force
false - set tap

I still adhere to the approach that the default should be the default, and not to change anything in the settings

Patch Set 4:

The basetestclass upr and vbuckets params are not part of any test case, so your research won't find them. I use them when debugging tests. I can take a tap based cluster and run test using UPR and vice-versa. I can take a cluster with vbucket set to 1024 but run my test using 128 vbuckets. Also, anyone can add different vbuckets/upr/tap tests to the same config by adding these params. 

My goal was to avoid installation based setting of parameters. Or when they are set, we can change them during tests and restore once test is complete.

Patch Set 4:

I have converted upr to tap in basetestclass. This way we keep upr as default and change to tap if necessary.
