I agree with the changes but have one question concerning old commit. please see my question inside

Line:218, pytests/basetestcase.py -> I don't understand the logic with self.cleanup here. the initial commit is http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/35093/9/pytests/basetestcase.py. Parag, could you explain it?
