Patch Set 2:

Hi Aruna,

I run the same test and now I see "KeyError: 'replication_active_vbreps'"

https://friendpaste.com/2ZRu6mHN4TYwVKTcTjKaQp

we should think to understand how to best handle  'missed' stats because

 except KeyError as ex:
                self.log.info(ex)

it's not the best solution i think
