DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0: 2i test fixes

This parameter when True defines replica for indexes that are lost when an index

- Fix conf for drop index tests as it was not dropping index, only creating
- Mutations will now run in parallel for recovery tests. Previously they used
to run just before recovery happened.
