DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0: 2i test fixes

- Add parameter to use use_replica_when_active_down when running recovery testing.
This parameter when True defines replica for indexes that are lost when an index
node is moved during the test. If this is False, we use the primary index
- Fix conf for drop index tests as it was not dropping index, only creating
- Mutations will not run in parallel for recovery tests
