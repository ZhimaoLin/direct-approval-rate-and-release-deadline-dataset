Line:249, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_advancedcbqshell.py -> self.assertIn() can be used instead of self.assertTrue

Line:525, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> It is a good practice to provide error message in case assert fails.

Line:2749, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> name if the test is not clear

Line:2760, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> expected_result and expected_result2 looks identical. one of them can be removed.

Line:2763, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> how is it made sure that REVERSE actually reverses the result?

Line:3123, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> self.assertEqual can be used here

Line:3126, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> There are empty lines here in code? Is that intentional?

Line:3708, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> the commented out part can be totally removed from the code.
