Line:85, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Can we do something like this?

available_replicas = self.num_replicas
if len(servers) < self.num_replicas:
    available_replicas = len(servers) - 1

Adding more if-else statements is confusing here.

Line:98, pytests/basetestcase.py -> We can still do replica verification even if we don't have all of the replicas available.

Line:98, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Mike, I saw situation..., for instance: one node with replica=3, 1000 docs uploaded-> add 1 node, rebalance cluster. result: node1: active/replica=498/502, node2: active/replica=502/498. what in this cases should be? Should it work as replica=2 (500/500)?
