Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Line:8, conf/py-xdcr-bidirectional.conf -> Could we instead check if conflict resolution is random? But that would involve saving the hash value of first updated key to compare against if hash exception is thrown. By 3.5.0 timeframe we are expected to have time-stamp based conflict resolution. So it's ok if we want to comment this too.
