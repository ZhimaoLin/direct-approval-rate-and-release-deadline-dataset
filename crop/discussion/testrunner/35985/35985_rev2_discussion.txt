Can you give us a log that this removal of delay won't have a negative impact

Patch Set 2:

I'd recommend to split this change into 2 patches:

1. Trivial "consolidate and increase sleep time for force_eject_node"

For this change it also makes sense to explain guys why greater wait time is required.

2. CLI related fix in assertion.
