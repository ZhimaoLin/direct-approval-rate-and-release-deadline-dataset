Line:19, cbtestlib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> this may not be in this scope, better to put cbtestlib stuff together.

Line:19, cbtestlib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> obviously. but in future patches.

there is general convention regarding order of import statements:

1. standard library imports

2. related third party imports

3. local application/library specific imports

eventually we will follow this rule.
