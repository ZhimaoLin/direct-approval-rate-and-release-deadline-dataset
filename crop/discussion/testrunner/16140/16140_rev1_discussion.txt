Line:27, pytests/basetestcase.py -> if self.input.param("skip_cleanup", True): also works here, right?

Line:27, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Yes, but we want the default to be false. For example I think makes more sense for a developer to put "skip_cleanup=True" in there config to skip cleanup. Your way would require them to say "skip_cleanup=False" to skip cleanup.
