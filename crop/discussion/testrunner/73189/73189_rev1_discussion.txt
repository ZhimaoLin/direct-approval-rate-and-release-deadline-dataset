Line:24, pytests/security/internal_user.py -> no need for try and catch here? looks like you are doing it in ldap

Line:34, pytests/security/internal_user.py -> it will be helpful in debugging if we log the exception here

Line:3504, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> looks like we are returning the content on success - not a bool value - please change annotation accordingly

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:5, pytests/security/user_base_abc.py -> This is an abstract class for user type. Each user creation class should inherit this abstract class and have an implementation of methods in this class.
