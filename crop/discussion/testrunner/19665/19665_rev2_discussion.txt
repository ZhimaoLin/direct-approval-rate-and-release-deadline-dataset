DESCRIPTION

CBQE-494: wrong return value in is_membase_installed

func should be named is_couchbase_installed

func is_membase_installed worked as follows:
it verified if couchbase is installed( file /opt/couchbase/VERSION.txt exists) and returned false if it's so
so, we really did not check whether membase is installed, but saw if couchbase is installed.
I don't know exactly how to verify if  membase is  installed(membase catalog structure was /opt/membase/_version/),
and I use now existing approach to identify that couchbase is installed( by  /opt/couchbase/VERSION.txt file)
