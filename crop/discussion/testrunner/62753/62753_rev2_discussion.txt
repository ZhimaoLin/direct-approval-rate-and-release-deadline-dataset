Line:2665, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> This is fine for now, but I imagine going forward that more than just Centos 7 will use systemd. It might make more sense to switch based on the existence of /usr/lib/systemd/system/couchbase-server.service (I believe that path is a fixed constant path in the systemd world).
