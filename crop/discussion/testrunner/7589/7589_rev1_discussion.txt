modified testrunner code to work with ns_server

refactored entire test runner and removed hardcoded memcached/moxi
port numebrs from test helper methods and test cases. helper methods and data:loader
methods can discover the memcached/moxi port from :pools/default.
same applies to bucket port and bucket password.
