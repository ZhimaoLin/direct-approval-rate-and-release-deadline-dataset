Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(5 inline comments)

Looks good overall, but small set of changes needed.

Line:17, pytests/backup/opsduringbackup.py -> follow the coding guideline.. 
see the comments section. "how to add comments in the code"

Line:29, pytests/backup/opsduringbackup.py -> store items instead of noise items?

Line:33, pytests/backup/opsduringbackup.py -> take self.backup_location as the user input. and default to /tmp/backup

Line:37, pytests/backup/opsduringbackup.py -> Its alright now, but think, what will happen if your backup is slow or stuck?
your test is going to hang in the backup_thread join()

Line:132, pytests/backup/opsbeforebackup.py -> how is this verifying key against the single node?
