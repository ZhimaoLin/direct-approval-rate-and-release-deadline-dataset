Line:18, pytests/autocompaction.py -> Please reverrt this change, since this is not directly impacting xdcr or related changes.

Line:12, lib/tasks/task.py -> This file cannot be deleted.

Line:30, b/resources/xdcr/dev-ref-xdcr-rebalance.ini -> Do not hard-code this as any server-names, we generally add them to be compatbile with cluster_run ie 127.0.0.1:9000 onwards

Line:114, pytests/xdcr-mod/rebalancexdcr.py -> I could be missing this, but where is the create load here? ie which documents are being updated here? Does this show mutation on the same prefix?
