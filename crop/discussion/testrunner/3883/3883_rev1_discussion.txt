Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This looks like it copies a lot from the previous test.  Perhaps you should contain this stuff into a library?

Line:114, bin/persistence_database_crash.py -> Is this the same as in your other script?  It looks pretty complicated -- we should probably contain that into a shell script we just deliver to the other side in a way that's a bit more readable.

Patch Set 1:

Agree. I spent some time before on creating the library that contains the common modules used in our testing scripts. But, there are still some duplicate parts in those scripts. I will put those additional common parts in the library.
