Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Two minor comments on these changes based on some things that were changed around in the tools today. They should only cause minor changes to your tests. Also, we may need to add three more tests for cbbackup/cbrestore, but I need to work out some details with PM before we do. If we do add them though they should be easy to add given the infrastructure you've already built.

Line:7, conf/entbackuprestore/py-entbackuprestore.conf -> I just updated the code to allow backup and restore between conflict resolution types when --force-updates is enabled. The reason is that forcing updates skips the conflict resolution phase anyways so there is not need to block this type of restore.

Line:116, conf/entbackuprestore/py-entbackuprestore.conf -> Can you remove the disable-conf-res-restriction from the 3 tests below since it is no longer required.
