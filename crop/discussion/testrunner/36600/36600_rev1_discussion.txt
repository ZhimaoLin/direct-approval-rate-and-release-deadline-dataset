Patch Set 1:

Andrei, the changes look good but currently there are no dgm tests in our functional suite. So wouldn't the addition of this param only be relevant to those cases? I also hoping there are full eviction functional tests somewhere.

Patch Set 1:

full eviction almost never used now, but even without dgm we should have at least 20 percent of all tests with full eviction(when we create buckets) because it's not default value on UI.
