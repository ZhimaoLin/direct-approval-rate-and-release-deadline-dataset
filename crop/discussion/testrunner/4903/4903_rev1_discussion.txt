Line:1, /COMMIT_MSG -> I created too many commits for changes that I should have used git commit --amend instead of commiting a new one.
I will abandon all changes except the first one.

Patch Set 1:

You don't want large commits when you can have a few small ones that solve individual problems.

It's up to the project owner for the most part.  Do try to get the commit form to be as good as possible, though.
