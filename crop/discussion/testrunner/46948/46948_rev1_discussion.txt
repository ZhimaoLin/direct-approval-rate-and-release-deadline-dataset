Hi Trevor Santana, Could you also enabled the RO, Admin tests you had on the previous review, or are they a part of another suite.

Hi Trevor Santana,

One comment for using the audit code, I would rather create a wrapper and use it in the code. This way anything changes in future with audit code can be handled in the wrapper itself. 

thanks
Ritam
