Patch Set 9:

(1 comment)

this is going to break compliance too early for non-libcouchbase vms we have in jenkins.  proposed a softer transition - see comments

Line:16, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> How about we start phasing out data_helper instead of adding to it?  In this case also the import here causes all of test-runner becomes dependent on python-sdk and furthermore libcouchbase.

I propose that tests that need to use SDKClient will themselves import it.  And whatever functionality is here in this data_helper module that we want we can do the alternative in SDKClient itself.
