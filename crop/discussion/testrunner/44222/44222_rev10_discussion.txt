Abandoned

found an issue for python sdk. Currently the couch base manifest has older version of python sdk being used for server tools. This is why our python sdk Hugo Blankenship breaks. We cannot change it to the latest version (for which we have coded our test runner). The solution that should work is to keep two versions of python sdk support within test runner and use the installed one in an automated way.

Will revisit this change later.
