Line:15, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> with such verification methods it's better to use parameters like view_name_add, veiew_name_del, etc..., so the same method can be adopted for different tests from  test plan related to the same verification part. it can be even extended for negative cases. but for initial state, it's okay.
