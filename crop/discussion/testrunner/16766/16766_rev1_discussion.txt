DESCRIPTION

MB-5442: XDCR unit tests has incorrect parameters

Today for XDCR unit tests, the number of vbucket is set to 1024
and the number of max correct replication per doc is set to 8.
These parameters has made XDCR unit tests unnecessarily long, and
both will be modified to 64. A new target "make test-xdcr" is
added.
