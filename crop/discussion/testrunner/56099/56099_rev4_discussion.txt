Patch Set 4:

(4 comments)

Line:40, pytests/fts/es_base.py -> break line

Line:49, pytests/fts/es_base.py -> these are static by definition, you can move them under __init__()

Line:64, pytests/fts/es_base.py -> Something wrong in this comment, break line.

Line:81, pytests/fts/es_base.py -> Why not just use dictionary instead of namedtuple here? 1. It's easier for understanding 2. saves the conversion back to dict.

Any spl reason for using namedtuple?
