Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Trevor Santana, Sorry I didn't communicate this to you. We decided to do a complete rewrite of these tests in memcapable.py and model it on something like new rebalance tests e.g. pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py. 

This will allow us to use new document loading task, VBucketAwareMemcached, StatsWaitTask etc..

I think we can create a new test file for these tests.
