Patch Set 1:

I'm not sure that we should extend the tests through adding new tests. we can change the tests selectively:
we can change the tests selectively:
sasl_buckets=1,default_bucket=False
sasl_buckets=2,default_bucket=False,standard_buckets=1
default_bucket=True,standard_buckets=1
and etc.

Trevor Santana, do we support all these variations in view tests?
