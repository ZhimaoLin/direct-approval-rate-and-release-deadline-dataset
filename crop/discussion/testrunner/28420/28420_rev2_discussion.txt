Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Setting environment variable will have no effect. The right way to adjuct failure restart interval is via internalSettings.

Patch Set 2:

I understand that this wouldn't affect any of the newer builds, but it does help all those testcases when 2.0.0's are involved in the upgrade. There are many test cases where source is 2.0.0 and destination is 2.1.0+.
