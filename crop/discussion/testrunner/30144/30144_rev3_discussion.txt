Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

(2 comments)

Line:79, pytests/flush/bucketflush.py -> again, will this test fail if flush doesn't raise an exception? - No, but it have to.

It's ok to catch any exception. But still we need <else> block:::

    try:
        operation_that_can_throw_error()
    except Exception as exp:
        handle_the_exception_somehow() # assertEqual and other checks
    else:
         #no exception was raised
        operation_that_we_perform_if_we_have_no_error() # we have to fail test here, because we expect an error

and also does this <else Exception> expression exist in python?

Line:111, pytests/flush/bucketflush.py -> previous option was ok, what is wrong with it?
