Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:74, pytests/flush/bucketflush.py -> there are still extra whitespaces

Line:79, pytests/flush/bucketflush.py -> we still need <else> block. Example: we expect that error ABC will raise. But it wasn't. Test should fail(expected results are not equal to actual), without <else> block test will pass, which is false positive
