Patch Set 5: Verified+1

Trevor Santana, sorry about the too many back and forths. I was just wondering if we should fail the test if an expected exception was not seen. I wasn't sure if there could be a scenario where a different or no exception is thrown but the statements in the try block are successfully executed (that is how this has been originally coded).

I've anyway added a generic exception exception handler and the else block causing the test to fail. Right now, when I execute the test, I only see the expected exception handled. So long as we see exceptions, we are good. I've tested the changes, the else exception was a good catch.

I've repeated the same changes at another function which makes use of  'with AssertRaises()' .Thanks.
