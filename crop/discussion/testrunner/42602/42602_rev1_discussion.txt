Line:299, lib/membase/helper/spatial_helper.py -> There could be 2 types of failures.
1. Expected rows != returned rows (In this case, the results will contain information)
2. Returned rows =0 - the error condition where results{} is empty.

I would prefer keeping this output for condition #1 - we have used similar error outputs for views-where it was useful to debug how many missing rows/ v/s expected rows on the test.
