Sorry for the delay with the review. I must have missed it somehow.

I'll verify it tomorrow.

Line:64, conf/dev-py-viewquery.conf -> Why do those tests skip the rebalance and don't run on the full cluster?

Patch Set 2:

I should have added that it would be good if the commit message would be more explanatory. It could mentioned that the viewquery now run on the cluster by default and not on a single node as before.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:64, conf/dev-py-viewquery.conf -> they are parametrized, see below - nodes_to_add is a parameter to enable rebalance
