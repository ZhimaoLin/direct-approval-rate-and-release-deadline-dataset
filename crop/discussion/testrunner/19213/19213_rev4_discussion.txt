Patch Set 4: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

In conf/py-viewquer.conf these four tests fail:
    test_employee_dataset_startkey_endkey_queries_rebalance_in,max-dupe-result-count=10    test_employee_dataset_startkey_endkey_queries_rebalance_in,max-dupe-result-count=10,num_nodes_to_add=3    test_employee_dataset_startkey_endkey_queries_rebalance_out,max-dupe-result-count=10,    test_employee_dataset_startkey_endkey_queries_rebalance_out,max-dupe-result-count=10,num_nodes_to_rem=3

They pass when skip_rebalance=true is added.

Still running the conf/dev-py-viewquery.conf tests I wasn't even aware that they exist :)

Patch Set 4: (1 inline comment)

I've tried to run dev-py-viewquery.conf, but it died as I ran out of disk space. Though I had one failing test which was missing the `skip_rebalance=true`, see the inline comment.

Please rerun all the tests again and make sure there are not tests that miss the `skip_rebalance=true` or tests which have it set, but should run on the full cluster.

Line:2, conf/dev-py-viewquery.conf -> Needs a `skip_rebalance=true`

Patch Set 4: (11 inline comments)

I just couldn't resist and take a look at the most suspicious ones and try them. Note that I haven't run all of the dev-py-viewquery.conf, but only those where I've added an inline comment.
