DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0: resolve all conflicts due to couchbase name clash for python sdk

python sdk has a package name couchbase and so does testrunner's lib/couchbase.

This causes a conflict during import when using python sdk as we end up using testrunner's couchbase.

We cannot change python sdk naming, meanwhile testrunner's couchbase name can be changed. This fix resolves this conflict
