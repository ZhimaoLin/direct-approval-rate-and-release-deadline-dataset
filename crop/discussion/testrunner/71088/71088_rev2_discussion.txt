DESCRIPTION

2i - Add a check to verify cluster status in test_rebalance_in

Before performing after recovery tasks, there is no check if the
cluster is in healthy state. Check if all the nodes in the cluster
are healthy before doing any post recovery task.

Change Query Definition to remove dead code and recategorize
queries into various groups.
