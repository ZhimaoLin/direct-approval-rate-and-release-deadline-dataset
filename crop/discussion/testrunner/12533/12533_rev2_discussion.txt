DESCRIPTION

Improve cluster helper

The add_and_rebalance method of the ClusterOperationHelper
doesn't need to have the password as a parameter, as it
can get it from the master server object.

This simplifies the call and makes the whole method less
fragile. The username isn't hardcoded to "Administrator"
anymore.

The logging was improved, the port of the server is now
part of the output.
