DESCRIPTION

CBQE-1350: Store HTTP status code as property

Store the returned HTTP status code in a property and don't add
it to the error message. There's currently code that checks for
the error message that would break. Having a separate property
is the cleaner approach anyway.

It would be cool if you could review it soon, as it unbreaks one of the couchdb commit validation tests.
