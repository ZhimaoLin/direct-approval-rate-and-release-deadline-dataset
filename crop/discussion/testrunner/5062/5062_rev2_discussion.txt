DESCRIPTION

migrated few tests from shell scripts to python

migrated set-get,version-check and balance-node2 to python

-tried to copy test operations from the existing ones
-started using assertXYZ methods to fail the test or
test cleanup if there is a failure
-using unittest classes to split a test into setup/test/cleanup
unittest will run the setup for us before every test method in
the module
-version-check test uses /pools rest api to obtain the
version number for each node
-simple-set-get test will load each server with number of keys
and then verifies that those keys are stored. in the cleanup
part we also delete these keys from the server
-add_rebalance loops over all the servers in the server list
and adds those servers to the master node , verifies the cluster
status by using 'nodeStatuses' and 'rebalanceStatuses' rest apis
and asserts if the status is not healty or balanaced after rebalance
-as part of the setup and cleanup we also clean up the cluster
by removing the nodes which the previous test did not cleanup
properly
