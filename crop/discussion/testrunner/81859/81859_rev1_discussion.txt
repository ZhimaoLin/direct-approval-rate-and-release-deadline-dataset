Line:4373, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> If you are anyway increasing the timeout, waking up every 5 seconds is a good idea than sleeping for 20s. In general, it's good to wake up more often and check than sleep longer. Long sleeps slow down tests.

I do not know the specifics/context of this problem, so pls have Prerna approve this.
