Line:39, lib/membase/helper/rebalance_helper.py -> we shouldn't pass the servers here.
we can always extract the servers from nodesStatuses and  get the stat for that server.

Line:39, lib/membase/helper/rebalance_helper.py -> get_nodesStatues would not contain the ssh_username information

doing 
 rest = RestConnection(master)
 servers = rest.node_statuses()
will not help 
, is there some other way?

Line:39, lib/membase/helper/rebalance_helper.py -> we dont need ssh username password . 
to create a restconnection instance you need the ip + rest_username+ rest_password which you can get master 

ip from nodeStatuses and rest_u/rest_p from master
