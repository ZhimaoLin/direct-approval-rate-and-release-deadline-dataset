DESCRIPTION

Rbac_base does not currently allow for the assiging of roles to multiple
different users at once. This is because final_roles is never reset, so the
roles of the previous user still remain inside of final_roles. Changed rbac_base
to reset final_roles after the roles are set for the previous user.
