Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Just updating with info from our convo yesterdayâ€¦. 
Negative tests can be implemented by adding error state to QueryHelper class (or setting expected_num_docs = -1), I think that will be the better way to go instead of propagating the 'error' variable all the way down test code.  In run_queries you can check the query object and see if error is expected, run query, catch expected exception and let test continue.
