Patch Set 4:

I am not very familiar with python nor the testrunner framework.
But looking at commit message and Jira ticket, I can't realize what changes is about exactly.

What do you mean by negative cases for limit?
?limit=-N is not supported, but I guess you all now that and this is about something else

Patch Set 4:

There are positive and negative testing. Positive means that you do right things and expect some right actions to be done. Negative cases means that we try to execute something wrong, in this case for limit parameter. For example, limit=a, limit=-4, limit=%, etc. We expect that error will be appeared in the result. If no errors will be raised so this is incorrect behaviour
