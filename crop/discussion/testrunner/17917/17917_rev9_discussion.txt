I dont see anywhere in the code where you are rebalancing the nodes in... 

and creating a cluster.

Line:11, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> not used

Line:13, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> This is not used anywhere

Line:18, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> why are u creating bucket on each node.

Line:29, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> same as below

Line:36, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> this should be start=start instead of 0.

Line:73, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> self.timeout

Line:173, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> can you change this to 
threshold = self.input.param('threshold', stats[ep_threshold])

This will allow us to load items upto user specified threshold

Line:183, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> use items variable

Patch Set 9: (3 inline comments)

This Automation covers the basic scenario of WarmUp, Rebalancing,Partial WarmUP ,COmpaction and Failover still needs to be implemented

Line:29, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> below one is for asynchronous mode

Line:173, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> similar logic has been implemented

Line:183, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> both self.num_items and items variable are for different use
