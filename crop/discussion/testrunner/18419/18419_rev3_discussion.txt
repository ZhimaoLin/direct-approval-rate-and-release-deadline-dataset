Line:64, pytests/backup/opsduringbackup.py -> we also need to make changes for the backup_base.py because it involve the change of buckets data structure

Line:43, pytests/backup/opsbeforebackup.py -> The following code is a good change that adapt my code to use the _create_standard_buckets() and _create_ssl_buckets() in the basetestcase when we want to recreate the bucket. We should also make this change to opsduringbackup.py and the function CreateUpdateDeleteExpireBeforeBackup() in this file.
