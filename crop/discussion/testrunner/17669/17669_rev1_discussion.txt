Line:143, pytests/xdcr.py -> Does VBMC guarrantee that  the order of reading all items are the same? If not, that will break the test even the data set are identical on both clusters.

What about sort the list on the key before return the list to caller?

Line:149, pytests/xdcr.py -> Looks like order matters when comparing two lists in python.

I tried 
In [1]: a  = [1, 2]
In [2]: b =  [2, 1]

In [3]: a == b
Out[3]: False

Line:143, pytests/xdcr.py -> key is from keystore and I iterate over same list of keys to fetch the rev information from both clusters. So it would maintain the order.

Line:149, pytests/xdcr.py -> Done
