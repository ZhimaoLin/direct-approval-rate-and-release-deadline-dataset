Line:59, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> Here you are assuming that at least 2 servers are passed.. 
if not passed.. this would fail... 
check if the ini file has just one  server.

Line:66, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> Forgot to mention but can you try to use %s instead of format. 

%s works with other python version as well

Line:181, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> you can just write this as . self.input.param("active_resident_threshold", 110)..
no need to cast int

Line:184, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> same here

Line:59, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> sure

Line:66, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> sure will do that

Line:181, pytests/warmup/warmuptest.py -> yes, but casting will make the intention clear and make code easy to maintain and avoid potential bug because of implicit casting
