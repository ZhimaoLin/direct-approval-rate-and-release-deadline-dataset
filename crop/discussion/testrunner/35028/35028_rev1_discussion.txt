Currently, the monitor.py does not work where it has to go back in time and fetch data for -T seconds. I am trying to fix, please comment on rest of the code.

FYI, I have tested the code and it works. I will also write a wiki and add it to the system test framework. You can check it out on 172.23.106.3
