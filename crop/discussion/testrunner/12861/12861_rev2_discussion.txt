Patch Set 2: (5 inline comments)

nice set of changes.. some things to consider changing in the comments..

Line:25, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> Can we paramaterize... 
all these tests as 

test_get_view_during_x_min_load_y_working_set and pass x and y from the input.... u can use the parami method in the viewtests. 

Also... update the py-view.conf file.

Line:111, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> 12 attempts seems to be a lot?... it going to take more time??

Line:31, pytests/viewtests.py -> Can we just have one.. and not use 2 variables..

Line:74, pytests/viewtests.py -> Volker is fixing this part.. soon... i would suggest wait for his checkin... 2 ppl would be working on the same fix..

Line:774, pytests/viewtests.py -> Not a test question, but in general.. what happens if end_index==start_index..
