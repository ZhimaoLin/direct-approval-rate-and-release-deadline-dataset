Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

This causes high contention in this class and will make it almost impossible to use in a multi-threaded client. For now it's ok, but we should really find a better implementation that just locking the entire class in the future.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

we need to find a better way of locking the class and lock it less often.

pushing this change now but we can continue reviewing the code and submitting the fixes later
