Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I don't like the long lines, but I like what they do.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

(2 inline comments)

neat change.
can't wait to have test results in the db and start pushing even more info there - for instance how much time rebalance operation takes for how many nodes and how many items :)

few comments to add more generic classes to testrunner.

Line:67, TestInput.py -> let's have this as a key,value parameter instead of new argument so that the test cases can also have access to this value in case they want to push in more info to couchdb

Line:129, testrunner -> we should just define a class or dictionary object "test" and pass the same thing to xunit class and test_database class.
also let's define a super class called reporter that implements add_test method and have a "reporters" array as part of test runner so that we can addd more reporters later and each reporter can do its own thing.
