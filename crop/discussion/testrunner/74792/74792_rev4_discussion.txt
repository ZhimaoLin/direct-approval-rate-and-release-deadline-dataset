DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3776: Make num dataloading processes static

When running in high thoughput mode the number of processes are
based on number of cpu's.  This can be problematic on systems that
run multiple instances on a single host, and especially on containers
that share cpu's, leading to errors like the following:
 |||  ValueError: task_done() called too many times

This change sets the default parallel processes to 4
