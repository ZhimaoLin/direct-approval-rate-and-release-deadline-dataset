Line:1366, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> No need of this variable here.

Line:1382, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> cluster_async function returns a single task here.

Line:1398, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> I am not sure if we need to check it on each node, its enough to check on any node since it is ns_server information.
