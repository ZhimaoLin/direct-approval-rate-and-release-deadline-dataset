Don't know about the Python code itself, but noticed a typo that can be a problem.
Also the commit message, quering -> querying

Line:475, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> view_intergrity -> view_integrity

Line:475, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> this typo is propagated through all class, the method is named exactly in this way
