DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2198: upr_bin_client for testrunner

* Add upr opcodes to memcachedConstants
* Add upr operations into a separate client (upr_bin_client)

Until we are able to move to public python sdk and gain upr support adding this to our internal client. This is necessary because pBraylon Arnoldpr cannot do advanced failure cases like ssh and stop nodes or stream during view/xdcr.
Considered porting pBraylon Arnoldpr itself but it duplicates mc_bin so made this to inherit instead

Example stream request of 100 items from vbucket0.
        client = UprClient()
        client.open_producer('mystream')

        vbucket = 0
        response = client.stream_request(vbucket, 0, 100, 0, 0, 0)
        stream = client.get_stream(vbucket)

        while stream.has_message():
            message = stream.next_message()
