Patch Set 1:

Adding the ability to change the intra-cluster checkpoint parameter. This would help us test persistence issues due to check-point. We will also use this in rebalance and failover tests.

Line:1107, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> it's better to return status, content:
return self.diag_eval("ns_config:set(chk_period, "+period+")")

Line:800, pytests/basetestcase.py -> are you sure that we should change parameters only for master and before _initialize_nodes?
