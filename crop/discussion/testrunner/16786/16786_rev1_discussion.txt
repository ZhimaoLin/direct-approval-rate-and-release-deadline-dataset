Line:13, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Please give this test case a better title.

Line:9, pytests/rebalance/rebalance_base.py -> All three of these parameters should be added to the specific test case. The general way of thinking here should be that if a parameter is defined in the RebalanceBaseTest setUp then it should be used in all of the subclass testcases. Since this is not the case I don't think it is appropriate here.

Line:11, pytests/rebalance/rebalance_base.py -> This line is way too complex. Please split it up.
