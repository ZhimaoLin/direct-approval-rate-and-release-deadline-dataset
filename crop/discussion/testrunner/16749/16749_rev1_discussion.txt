Line:512, lib/tasks/task.py -> You should be passing in a View here, not a view_name, map_func, and red_func.

Also, prefix should be named dev_view and be a boolean.

Line:525, lib/tasks/task.py -> Views appears unused.

Line:535, lib/tasks/task.py -> You should never catch Exception. Specify the specific errors you are expecting to catch.

Line:544, lib/tasks/task.py -> Same exception comment.

Line:557, lib/tasks/task.py -> Same exception comment.

Line:558, lib/tasks/task.py -> Do not use retries. Futures allow you to specify a timeout value so this code is unnecessary.

Line:512, lib/tasks/task.py -> what is View ?
is it a class that encapsulates all properties related to a view ?

its up to Tommie/Voliker/Andrei/Mike but i prefer that we use json objects more and use the Class less for holding data structures

Line:512, lib/tasks/task.py -> Whether or not others feel the View and DesignDocument classes are useful there are still too many parameters in this task. The view should be created in the test code and passed in. We shouldn't pass in all of the view fields seperatly.

Line:512, lib/tasks/task.py -> Yep makes sense to pass in View class from test. Line 528 here can be outside of this scope and passed in as single variable.

Line:535, lib/tasks/task.py -> fixing... note we also have this in RebalanceTask.

Line:558, lib/tasks/task.py -> example somewhere?
