The chain_length is for someone looking at the conf to immediately know how many clusters are being tested in a particular test. Ideally this must be <= the number of clusters specified in ini file. Say I have 4 clusters defined in .ini. I have 3 tests- 1. chain_length=1 (C1->C2) 2. chain_length=2 (C1->C2->C3) 3. chain_length=3 (C1->C2->C3->C4) All the above must be possible.
chain_length=1 must be supported so we can move existing tests to newxdcrbasetests.py. This can be done in a separate commit too. Feel free to merge.

Line:1378, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> break after 'and' bring len to next line.
