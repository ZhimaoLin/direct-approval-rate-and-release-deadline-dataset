Line:1107, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> I think this was also changed thinking existing 2 cluster tests will never use this code. In the longer run, we should aim at moving all tests to new basetests.

Line:1604, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> As far as possible, try to use the 79/80 per line limit. I see many function calls spanning many lines only containing one argument per line. While this is a programming style, it requires frequent scrolling and makes files very long.
Small methods are inviting to read.

Line:3, conf/py-xdcrnewtopologytest.conf -> what is the default chain length? user should be able to specify that.  Say chain_length=2 would mean we have C1->C2->C3. I understand this depends on how many clusters they specify in .ini file but the implementation must support chain_length>=2.

Pls add a brief comment here on how to specify the required topology. This is very important.

Line:2, pytests/xdcr/newxdcrtopologytest.py -> This file can be named xdcrTopologyTests.py. We never had complex topology tests before. Or in keeping with other files in /xdcr, you could name it complexTopologyXDCR.py

Line:11, pytests/xdcr/newxdcrtopologytest.py -> How about "Atleast 3 clusters are needed to run this test. Please specify cluster information in .ini file"

Also, I was hoping this code could be used to move the existing C1->C2, C1<->C2 tests else it will lead to code duplication. We can take the chain_length param and check the number of clusters available in .ini file.

Line:69, pytests/xdcr/newxdcrtopologytest.py -> These 3 calls can be grouped into a method say setup_xdcr_and_load() and called in all tests.

Line:1107, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Done

Line:1604, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> I have enabled autopep8 settings in eclipse. Eclipse is doing as per the standard.

Line:3, conf/py-xdcrnewtopologytest.conf -> I couldn't understand chain_length parameter. Do you mean, evenif we have 4 clusters in INI file but we need to use 3 Clusters? Also, Please mention the significance of it, since it will require changes in base class code to. Can we achieve the same it through GROUP parameter, based on the INI file mentioned on the jenkin jobs?

Though added chain_length parameter.

Line:2, pytests/xdcr/newxdcrtopologytest.py -> Done.

Line:11, pytests/xdcr/newxdcrtopologytest.py -> Done. Added chain_length character.

Line:69, pytests/xdcr/newxdcrtopologytest.py -> Done
