Line:110, pytests/xdcr/esbasetests.py -> Why do the older calls exist then? Did the functionality/params change since they were last used?

The es_rest.client shows this definition for the all_docs

lib/membase/api/esrest_client.py:    def all_docs(self, keys_only = False, indices=["default"],size=10000):

Do we want to change the values to all default?

Line:110, pytests/xdcr/esbasetests.py -> Ok, so I didnt see that there is an EsRestConnection.
These changes I'll get rid of, and make the change on line77 to:
es_rest = EsRestConnection(dest_master) and import EsRestConnection.
