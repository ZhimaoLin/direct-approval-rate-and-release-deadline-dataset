Line:192, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> The naming convention is a bit confusing. Here source cluster is not really the source w.r.t to the ops being tracked. it is the destination. However, this convention is not introduced with this commit so can be tracked separately.

Line:380, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> Here, validation is done only on the source side with no validation on destination side that replica mutations are received. However, a system wide data consistency check at the end of the test so this seems an ok approach.

Line:192, pytests/xdcr/pauseResumeXDCR.py -> Agreed, the naming convention is same in the whole of xdcr suite. It needs to be changed separately.
