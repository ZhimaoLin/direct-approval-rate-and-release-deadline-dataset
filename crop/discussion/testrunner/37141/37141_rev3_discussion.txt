Line:392, pytests/swaprebalance.py -> maybe I'm wrong...
rebalance completed with failure before killing memcached: in this case reached=True, is_cluster_rebalanced=False(because 'is_cluster_rebalanced' return true if cluster balanced, false if it needs rebalance.
so, we get "If True and False:
                           ...
                           self.fail("rebalance failed even before killing memcached")

but we should go in this if-block

I something wrong?
