I don't really know how to test it properly. So if someone volunteered to do this for me, I'd be extremely grateful.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

my only concern is that it might not always work in past (i.e old code is apparently using ssh to change environment variables of ns_server ?). So it's possible that something that was working by mistake stops working now.

Unless ofcourse I'm missing something
