Hey Andrei - thinking this may not be what we want.  This will cause remote_info to get called every time.  In old change, at least if you set self.info = info then it would be skipped.

could you take a look closer at changes in "def extract_remote_info"

there should be no differences between the old and the new implementation
only decrease the size of the code, and do not need every time type

if getattr(self, "info", None) is None:
           self.info = self.extract_remote_info()

Patch Set 1:

guess what i'm saying is we don't run this method if self.info is None:
 self.extract_remote_info()

which save time. without this check extract_remote_info is always run
