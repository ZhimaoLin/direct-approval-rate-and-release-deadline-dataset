DESCRIPTION

CBQE-464 add cli test (cbcollect_info)

I add cbcollect_info from cli tools as a new automation job.
In this code, we load some items into cluster and use cbcollect_info
to generate a log zip file. We verify the whether all the logs generated
in the zip file and check whether all the bucket info is in stats.log
Also the test can only be on LINUX right now
