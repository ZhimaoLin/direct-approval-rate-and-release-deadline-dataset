Line:117, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> These are not test input parameter at all. There XDCR parameters, Please keep name as previous and actual xdcr parameter e.g. http://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-manual-2.2/#changing-internal-xdcr-settings. Please refer old base class https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py#L105.

Additionally, if we keep the name same, we can as it pass in rest_client.py and simply update the param_map={}.

Line:129, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Please create a static method get_defaults() which should return the dictionary, rather this constant. DEFAULTS is not XDCR_PARAM so it should not be class data member.

Line:315, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> It is unused here, anyways new base tests class will be used in sherlock now. you can remove it.

Line:453, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> mmm in that case please append "{" and "}" in the begining and at the end of the argument and call eval function, it will do everything for you.

Line:2053, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Its a local variable for if statement, Please initialize it at line 2060 only.

Line:2060, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Please use filter() instead of this for loop etc.

Line:848, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> If we keep the name of XDCR_PARAM class in xdcrnewbasetests.py then this code will be more simpler. just param_map.update(repl_spec) will do everything for you.

Implementation will be:

 param_map = {'replicationType': replicationType,	861
			'toBucket': toBucket,	862
			'fromBucket': fromBucket,	863
			'toCluster': toCluster,	864
			'type': rep_type	865
			}

if 3.5:
    param_map.update(repl_spec)


....

Line:454, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Please change __rpel_spec to __xdcr_prams.

Line:460, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> use update() function in dictionary to overwrite e.g.

>>> a={1:2}
>>> b={1:3}
>>> a.update(b)
>>> a
{1: 3}

Line:130, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> One more thing, I think in rest API we can give any xdcr parameter, and ns_server will itself take default value by itself. So I think there is no need of default values here. will only consider test params and pass it to replication rest api.

Line:117, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> And who takes care of start_replication calls outside of new xdcr basetests? like from system tests. I understand what you are saying but that is not correct. I'm merging my changes.

Line:315, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> what about xdcr upgrade tests? what's the problem in adding extra methods that are going to be used soon?

Line:454, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> These are not xdcr params these are per replication params.
