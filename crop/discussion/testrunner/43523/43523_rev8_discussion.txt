Line:627, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> mmm, Please check this.

Line:1897, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Why these comments are deleted.

Line:2049, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> How these comments are deleted?

Line:7, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Is there any plan to move these files from couchbase_helper to couchbase?

Line:116, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Why names are changed for parameters? Are they changed from xdcrFailureRestartInterval to failure_restart_interval on Rest API (ns_server) Couchbase cluster too on Sherlock?

Line:300, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> This function not in use, better to remove it now.

Line:436, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Please initialize in dictionary itself, e.g.

default = {XDCR_PARAM.FAILURE_RESTART:30, XDCR_PARAM.CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL:60, ...
}

Better way to create get_default() static function in XDCR_PARAM class which will return dictionary.

class XDCR_PARAM:
   ..
   ..

  xxx@xxx.xxx
    def get_default():
            return { XDCR_PARAM.FAILURE_RESTART:30, .......}


and call XDCR_PARAM.get_default() function here and update the value in default dictionary.

Line:451, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> nice!!. Can we give it like: xxx@xxx.xxx

in that case eval() function will directly convert string to dictionary. there will not be any need use re module then.

Line:454, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Use None instead of " ".

Line:488, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Please update with latest code, I think changes are made in old code. comments are not updated here.

Line:2032, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> How will filter_exp looks like? e.g. "loadOne1, loadOne2" ...?

Line:2042, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> What if key mentioned in filter expression not on the cluster itself? I mean not a valid key.

Line:2088, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Please log remote_cluster_ref.get_name() too.

Line:116, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> these are input params, rest params cannot be defined here. They need to be a part of rest_client.py. Rest params do not resemble input params either. start_replication in rest_client is called outside of this class too. So only test specific input params need to be defined here.

Line:300, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> will need it for sherlock features and backward compatibility.

Line:436, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Done

Line:451, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> I tried that, it requires every key and string value to be enclosed in quotes which I thought increases the complexity of input as opposed to one-time handling of input without quotes.

say this would work-
xxx@xxx.xxx
but even if a single quote goes missing, eval() will throw an error after bucket creation which is a lot of time to say input is wrong.

Line:454, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> ok

Line:488, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> oops, I did not realize that.

Line:2032, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> yes, it can also have regex.

Line:2042, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> we usually only specify a pattern. If no key matches the pattern, filtered_src_keys will be empty so we will not merge anything with dest bucket kvstore. This is correct because replication would not have happened for the same reason.

Line:2088, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> ok

Line:116, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Nope, Please refer to this manual http://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-manual-2.2/#changing-internal-xdcr-settings. We kept the XDCR param name same as it is on Rest API. Where it is defined in rest_client.py?

My question was are xdcr replication settings parameter names are changed in Sherlock, since you are passing it in rest api too.

I see you corrected rest_client.py now.
