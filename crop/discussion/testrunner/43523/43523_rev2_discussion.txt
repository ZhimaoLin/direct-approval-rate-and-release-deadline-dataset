Line:410, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> mmm there are two __init__ functions here. Please check and re-upload the patch for review..

Line:856, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> xdcr*** seems to be attributes be internal settings of replication, which can also be set through /internalSettings rest API? Is there any specific reason to pass it as parameter.

Line:410, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Oops! Done.

Line:856, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Apparently, it calls set_internalSetting(param, value) which only sets cluster-level hidden parameters @ localhost:8091/index.html?enableInternalSettings=1 -> edit internal settings.

So 
1. These are cluster level settings not replication specific.
2. Not all replication settings (say filter expression) are/will be present
