Hi Prerna, 

It looks good overal, though can you take a look at a few comments.

Line:42, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> Can you check-in every different area change separately.

Also, while changing default values, it would be good to not keep the doc-per-day to 1, it reduces the volume by default to 2016 please move to this to 5.

Line:1927, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> Can you check for covers in res instead of checking for "not"

Line:1933, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> trivial : please change this to self.log. and avoid using print.

Line:42, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> doc-per-day was 49 before..should I change it back to 49?

Line:1927, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> I was thinking that I can make a particular test fail if covers/cover is not found in first operator..where it is needed.
