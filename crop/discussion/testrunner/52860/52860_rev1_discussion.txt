Line:275, pytests/view/viewmergetests.py -> Could you throw an error instead? The point of this test is to test the dev views. I'd like to prevent that we end up not testing dev views at all.

Line:49, conf/view-conf/py-viewmerge.conf -> Do you perhaps needs a `last_case=true` here as well, so that the whole thing gets cleanup up properly?
