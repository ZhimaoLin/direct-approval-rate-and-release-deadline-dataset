Patch Set 2:

It appears that using a 7 byte prefix is fine, if we use a full md5sum then the view name gets too long.

I also reduced the deleted key count to 1 for this test (other tests can have a different amount of keys/deleted keys.)

Line:97, pytests/viewtests.py -> I think we should param this value of "1" num_of_deleted_docs.. 
either initialize this as global or under testconstants.
