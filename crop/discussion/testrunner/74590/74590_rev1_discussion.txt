DESCRIPTION

Added new tests for Autofailover related scenarios.
    1. Added tests for autofailover of nodes and validation of the failover for the following scenarios
            "firewall": enable_firewall,
            "stop_server": stop_couchbase_server,
            "restart_server": restart_couchbase_server,
            "restart_machine": restart_machine,
            "restart_network": stop_restart_network,
            "stop_memcached": stop_memcached,
            "network_split": split_network
    2. Added tests for autofailover with rebalance of nodes, with rebalance in progress, rebalance before failure, rebalance after failure.
    3. Added tests for autofailover of nodes and add back of nodes
    4. Added tests for autofailover of nodes with removal of nodes after failover
    5. Added methods to inject different failures into the system and validate the expected autofailover in the given time

Line:312, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> Can we do a validation that a command ran ?
Because when I run this on ubuntu I get the following output

xxx@xxx.xxx service network stop 
network: unrecognized service
xxx@xxx.xxx service network start
network: unrecognized service
xxx@xxx.xxx
