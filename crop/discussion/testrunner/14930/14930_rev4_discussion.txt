Line:215, lib/tasks/task.py -> The connection should be based off of server ip and port, so it works with cluster run

Line:219, lib/tasks/task.py -> can we also compare strings, basically only supporting equality/inequality?

Line:215, lib/tasks/task.py -> Will fix.

Line:219, lib/tasks/task.py -> Yes this logic should allow us to compare strings and the code I have written should handle this case. If I am wrong please let me know.
