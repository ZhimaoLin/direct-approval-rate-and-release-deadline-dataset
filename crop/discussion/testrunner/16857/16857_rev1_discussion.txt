Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

flushall_enabled is not yet working in testrunner. So I haven't been able to verify if this test will actually work specially the verification part.

Please also fix up whitespace.

Line:148, lib/tasks/task.py -> I think it would be better if we could supply a list of servers to flush.
