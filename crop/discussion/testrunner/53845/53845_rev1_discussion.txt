minor comments

Line:524, pysystests/app/systest_manager.py -> if 'services' in cluster:
      clusterMsg['services'] = cluster['services']

so. if by mistake we set value that is not from index, n1ql or kv then we get exception in responces and we can easy find mistake

Line:455, pysystests/app/rest_client_tasks.py -> "if services:" - it's easier

Line:524, pysystests/app/systest_manager.py -> Yes, agree.

Will change to 
if service in cluster:
      clusterMsg[services] =  cluster[services]

Line:455, pysystests/app/rest_client_tasks.py -> Doesnt work for some reason.

Also services is not None : ( which is std syntax doesnt work.)

I ll retry, but cannot ascertain if the above will work.
