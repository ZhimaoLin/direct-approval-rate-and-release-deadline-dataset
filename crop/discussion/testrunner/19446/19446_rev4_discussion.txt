Sorry for delay, I mistakenly commented your  the other  commit.

you have 4 the same test funcs in uni/bidirection classes:
swap_rebalance, swap_rebalance_replication_with_view_queries_and_ops, swap_rebalance_replication_with_ddoc_compaction and 
swap_rebalance_out_master

As far as I can see, each of them differs only by 2 lines. They can be parameterized.

The same can be done for all other test funcs

Line:160, pytests/xdcr/rebalanceXDCR.py -> why is it commented out?

Line:216, pytests/xdcr/rebalanceXDCR.py -> you don't need define task =[] here, it will be define bellow in async_create_views

Line:277, pytests/xdcr/rebalanceXDCR.py -> the same
