DESCRIPTION

CBQE-454 Parametize the item flags to load generator tasks

I parametize item flags to function _load_all_buckets in basetestcase.py,
to load_gen_docs in cluster.py and to LoadDocumentTask in task.py.
Item flag will also be stored in kvstore for those valid key set so I modify
the kvstore a bit.
I also add a item flag verification for ValidateDataTask.
