Patch Set 5:

Our tests are simplified and do not test the server behavior with items that have not yet expired.
for instance, we had cases like
1)load any data 
(with you changes all items are expired her—É)
2)rebalance, reboot, failover, etc....

so, we skip complex/customer scenarios when items can be in any state
