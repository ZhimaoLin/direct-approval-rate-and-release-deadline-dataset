DESCRIPTION

CBQE 4282:

Fixed test cases in dcp.rollback.DCPRollBack
1. Fixed replicate_correct_data_after_rollback. There was authentication failure as self.servers had 4 nodes in it, but the cluster were having only 2 nodes.
2. Fixed test_rollback_and_persistence_race_condition. The failover node was incorrectly specified. Also, recovery was missing before rebalance, so added delta recovery.
