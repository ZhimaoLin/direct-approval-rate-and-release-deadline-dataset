DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3685 create a structure to encapsulate bucket creation params.
Change cluster.py bucket_creation methods to accept less params.
Add create_bucket_params to basetestcase and any other tests that
don't use basetestcase. Change existing tests to work with the changes.

UPDATE1: deleted create_bucket_params from two places that did not need it.
