Line:347, pytests/buckettests.py -> you dont necessarily need to do this create_bucket_params you could instead do self.cluster.create_sasl_bucket(name=,password=,bucket_params=self.bucket_base_params['membase']['ephemeral'], but then you would have to pass bucket_size=100 in on the command line when running the test. ex. ./testrunner -i .ini -t testcase,bucket_size=100. The way you have it here is fine but if you want to get rid of this line there is already a set of ephemeral parameters provided by basetestcase
