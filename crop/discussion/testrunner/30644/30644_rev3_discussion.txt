DESCRIPTION

CBST-23: low ops during mixed workload

discovered heavy reading of ccq during mixed workload instead of in memory queue is causing lower than expected ops during mixed workload.
1) clients are already threaded, no need for subthreads to do get/set/delete/updates
   * just bump up numclients per process
2) only force reading from consume queue when miss_perc set
3) added some additional logging for debugging
