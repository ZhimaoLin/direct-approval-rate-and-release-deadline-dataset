Patch Set 2: (4 inline comments)



Line:15, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> no whitespaces

Line:85, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> I think you should have num-buckets as a param. 
this could default to 1. 

This way we can test xdcr with multiple buckets.

Line:122, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> error

Line:148, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> why is this a todo for mike?

Line:15, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> All the white spaces are with in comment section which usually are acceptable. In case of strict adherence , I will remove these white spaces too.

Line:85, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> As the work is in progess with respect to bucket creation so will definitely consider it.

Line:122, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> It is an expected error that should be ignored.This code is called from setup function where it is trying to clean the setup if it fails within the setup method. In practice it should not ever fail there untill  tests are not unit tested. Making it error could mislead the analysis. Anyway, I will still have a relook at it.

Line:148, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> This statement is copied from the basetestcase.py so to keep the consistency of comments too.

Line:96, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> I think there is another param called.. 
swap-orchestrator .. which should be initialized here?

Line:25, TestInput.py -> OrderedDict class is only available in Python 2.7.

Most environments use Python 2.6.

Please be extremely accurate with such changes. It may block all tests.

Line:25, TestInput.py -> thats an excellent point.... slaves mostly have python 2.6 installed... ... this would fail on more than half of the slaves we have.... 
Also testrunner should be compatible with python 2.6+.
