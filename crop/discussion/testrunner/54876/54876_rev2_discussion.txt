Pls remove whitespace in line 725. Rest looks ok.

Line:657, lib/tasks/task.py -> Do you want to log this? I was thinking if the node is not up in 15 secs, you would be printing this thrice for every key that failed set...or maybe the exception will fail the test. I'm not particular though.  You can keep it if it is important.
