DESCRIPTION

CBQE-1340 Fix bugs in plotter.py

We should not halt the script if there is something wrong with
snapshot report generation because it will prevent us to get those
raw 90th, max stats. We can generate report manually if needed.
Also, if user forget to kick off any stats collector, it should not
affect the script.
Also some format change due to event database stats format change.
