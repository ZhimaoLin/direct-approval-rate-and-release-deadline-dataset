Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Hi guys,

I suggest do not use default values like upr=False, xdcr_upr=False

(we should use None that does not change the default settings).
Here the problem is as follows: 
a) in general, we must test the standard installation, which the customer is supposed to be used. 
b) if we had A default value, and then the devs changed to B then we can  not take this into account and start testing with "not recommended" settings

Patch Set 1:

Andrei,

I'm not sure about UPR but XDCR on UPR is not a permanent option during installation in 3.0. Customers will not use this. It's a temporary solution to enable UPR path until the code is stable. Also, it doesn't have any default value. As per Dev, setting the variable to any value will enable the code for UPR. This being the case, should we still set it to None?

"Customers will not use this" --> I meant the environment variable.
