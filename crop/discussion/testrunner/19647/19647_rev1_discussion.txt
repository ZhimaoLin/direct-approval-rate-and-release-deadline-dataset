DESCRIPTION

CBQE-464 add cli test (cbdocloader)

I add docloader from cli tools as a new automation job.
In this code, we load sample files and verify the number of
items in the cluster. Right now the number of views verification
is not finished yet

Line:20, pytests/clitest/cli_base.py -> is this to avoid closing the ssh connection ?

Line:25, pytests/clitest/docloadertest.py -> seems like you made some changes to remote_util class .
can you create a new Jasmin Rangel review for those changes to remoteutil

Line:57, pytests/clitest/docloadertest.py -> none of these work with windows i think but for now i think we can have these tests work on linux

Line:20, pytests/clitest/cli_base.py -> Yes. Because usually for the first test case inside setUp() a tearDown() will be called to cleanup the cluster previous jobs left
