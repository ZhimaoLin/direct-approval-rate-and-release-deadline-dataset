Line:987, pytests/clitest/couchbase_clitest.py -> I am not sure if these setting available in sherlock.  If not, we need to put version condition in here so any run in 4.1.x would not break.  There is a self.cb_version got get version from cluster and list of from version in testconstant.py

Line:987, pytests/clitest/couchbase_clitest.py -> I tNathalie Landryed with Raju about this and he mentioned that we should not be doing this anymore. Trying to maintain the ability to run these tests across multiple versions will be a large amount of work. Also, the error messages change for commands between releases so most of these tests will not work on 4.1.x anyways. If you need to test 4.1.x you should check out testunner from the 4.1 label that QE makes after each release.
