DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2239: testrunner.py calls testrunner script

testrunner cannot be imported in some cases,
particually when multiprocess creates a child
process in windows and tries to reimport the parents source.
so this creates testrunner.py that calls testrunner script

Patch Set 2:

Isn't http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/37088/ a better solution? Is there a reason why testrunner have to be the real deal and not just be a wrapper to call into testrunner.py?

Patch Set 2:

Sure, that change looks better.  I was trying to be cautious not to change current script.
