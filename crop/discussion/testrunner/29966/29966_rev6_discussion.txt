Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1

(1 comment)

Looks good to me but please add test for CAPI mode XDCR. Thanks.

Line:12, conf/py-xdcrmerge.conf -> We also need to test the MB-8825 is fixed in CAPI mode XDCR.   In CAPI mode XDCR, the verification will be much simpler, you just need to make sure that at the end of verification stage:

ep_num_ops_del_meta =  0

ep_num_ops_set_meta =  0

ep_num_ops_get_meta >  0

You can either add to current test script, or create a separate test for that.
