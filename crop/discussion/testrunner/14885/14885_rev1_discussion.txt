Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)



Line:305, lib/tasks/task.py -> Adding return type here should be in a separate commit. Also, don't know if this is the best way to approach this since we only really care about the return type for a get command.

Line:326, lib/tasks/task.py -> Adding a uuid to a task name should be in a separate commit.

Line:370, lib/tasks/task.py -> Why can't the DocumentAccess just have an expiration field.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

as discussed today with Mike and Tommie I am going to push this change through and we can refactor and remove the expiration class later
