Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Thanks Parag, I've made a few more comments inline on the latest patch 5 here

Line:1931, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> is anything other than localhost supported?

Line:276, lib/couchbase/data_analysis_helper.py -> still think this isn't doing the right thing.  Wondering... how do you know you will not exceed the bounds of this array with index+=1 happening on each vkey?

also noted in patch2 comment what it looks like you want is:

for vkey in data:
   for i in range(len(data1))
       if data1[i] != data2[i]:
             "MISSMATCH"

also you'd want to check if len(data1) == len(data2).

Line:359, lib/couchbase/data_analysis_helper.py -> still using ssh?  I see you've imported lib_mc_bin client, is that working?

Line:472, lib/couchbase/data_analysis_helper.py -> spcs
