Patch Set 20: Code-Review+1

Parag thanks for the great efforts in this area. from my part there are no objections to the commit. The only thing that is not clear to me how it can be safely integrated with our tests. as I understand that clusterinfoanalysis is for testing analysis code but not server functionality? could you add some comments for this module.

Patch Set 20:

Andrei, it will be integrated as next step. It requires careful attention to detail as to how failover logs and vbucket information changes during rebalance, add-back, failover. I am in the process of collecting that information and then integrating it tomorrow onwards. 

I will add the comments as requested.

Thanks a lot for your comments. Helps me a lot.
