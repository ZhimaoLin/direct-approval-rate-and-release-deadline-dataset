still have some qs:
1) do you have some test outputs for common_test_body?
2) do you have any examples( with outputs) for methods: compare_all_dataset, compare_per_node_dataset, collect_data, collect_file_info, etc...

seems like they are never used now. somehow I'm not sure how it will work. maybe it makes sense to add in parts: what works and what is used.

3) for the following verifications:
self.compare_vbucket_seqnos(prev_vbucket_stats,servers,self.buckets)             	166
                self.compare_failovers_logs(prev_failovers_stats,servers,self.buckets)   

whether it will work if between prev_ values and now we have made some steps: rebalance(vbcuket changed), date updated, etc.

Line:32, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> seems like it's a test for debug and it checks only the work of the new functionality. like:
 a=getStats(); 
 b= getStats()
assertEquals(a,b)
Should we add it to commit?

Line:1946, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> what if file doesn't exist?

Line:122, lib/couchbase/data_analysis_helper.py -> parameters do not correspond to the real

Line:153, lib/couchbase/data_analysis_helper.py -> parameters do not correspond to the real
