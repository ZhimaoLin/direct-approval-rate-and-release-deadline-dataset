BTW, for me the following code does the same:
 info,memory_dataset=self.data_collector.collect_data(self.servers,self.buckets,data_path = None, perNode = True)
        info,disk_dataset=self.data_collector.collect_data(self.servers,self.buckets,data_path = data_path, perNode = True)

so, I mean that commands like:
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbtransfer http://10.6.2.145:8091 .. &
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbtransfer couchstore-files:///opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data ...
store data from the same source(from data folder on cb node).
and none of them uses the data from the memory.

So we just test that cbtransfer works the same for all options

Bin's response tell us that we can set the resident ratio to be 100% and do such comparisons. Also, without setting it, we are getting disk+memory vs disk comparison (which is the test). The test is quite basic and shows the API works. it will be mostly used to compare cluster when there is a difference in counts or similar counts but difference in data and its meta data.

Subject: Confirmation of cbtransfer when using http://localhost:8091 vs
couch store option

Let us confirm this with Bin and Chiyoung

Bin/Chiyoung, Andrei says the command to run cbtransfer gets data Not get
data from memory when using http://localhost:8091. Is this true?

From disk
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbtransfer
couchstore-files:///opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data
csv:/data/disk.csv -b default -u Administrator -p password
[bin] Since the data are read from couchstore files, obviously data
persist in disk already.

From memory
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbtransfer http://localhost:8091 csv:/data/mem.csv -b
default -u Administrator -p password --single-node
[bin] It will load data from BOTH memory and disk. If residential ratio
is 100, all data will be transferred from memory. But in DGM case, we
will transfer data from both memory and from disk.
