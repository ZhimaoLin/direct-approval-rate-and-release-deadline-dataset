DESCRIPTION

CBQE:0 Fix missing cbcollect and data files problem in xdcrnewbasetests
In a typical corner case after C1 is cleaned up, get-cbcollect-info value
becomes false which prevents C2's log collection. Also if data_verified 
is True for C1 but not C2, data files are not collected from C1.
Therefore collecting data files for all failed tests

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Issue is coming due to line 769-770 in original xdcrnewbasetests.py. Move this line to line 1875 (in original file) should solve this issue.
