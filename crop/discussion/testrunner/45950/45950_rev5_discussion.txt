DESCRIPTION

CBQE:0 Fix missing cbcollect and data files problem in xdcrnewbasetests
In a typical corner case during cleanup after C1 is cleaned up, get-cbcollect-info value becomes false which prevents C2's log collection. Also if data_verified is True for C1 but not C2, data files are not collected from C1. Therefore collecting data files for all failed tests
