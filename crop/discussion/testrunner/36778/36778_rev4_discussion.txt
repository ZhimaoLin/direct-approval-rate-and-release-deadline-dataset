Line:628, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> crash is single string, it's better to use elif or else

Line:643, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> how about to crash Source and destination at the same time? or: crash source, sleep n sec, crash dest, wait wait_warmup_completed on source and start data load on src, then wait that wait_warmup_completed on  dest, check data on dest

Line:648, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> the same.

Line:564, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> please don't add stop=True, becase in this case it's not warmup. use start node in your tests
