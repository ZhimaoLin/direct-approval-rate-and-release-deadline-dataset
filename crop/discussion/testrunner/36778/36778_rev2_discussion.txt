Line:623, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> why uni-xdcr? why not bi-xdcr?

Line:634, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> We may not need to load after crash, so do a blocking load before crash. You may see some exceptions after crash, pls handle those exceptions.

Line:636, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> why stop couchbase when already killed? Also there is no waiting till warmup here.

Line:654, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> Same as above

Line:623, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> I am not sure if it will bring much difference in this case, because we are crashing source, destination, both during XDCR. Do you have any other perception here.

Line:634, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> Done
