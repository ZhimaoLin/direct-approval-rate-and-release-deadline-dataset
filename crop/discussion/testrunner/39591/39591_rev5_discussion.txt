Line:61, pytests/view/viewquerytests.py -> we already have parameter  self.wait_timeout

https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/pytests/basetestcase.py#L57

it is very bad to have in each test your timeouts: timeout, wait_time, wait_timeouts, ....

Line:61, pytests/view/viewquerytests.py -> Hi Andrei, Thanks for the comments.
Yes i know about wait_timeout param but here we need to consider the timeout for only sanity cases and not for others.
However will look for the other alternative till then adding it as a temporary fix to avoid job failures.
