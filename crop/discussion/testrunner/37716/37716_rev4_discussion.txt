Line:32, pytests/transfer/cbtransfertests.py -> as I see the cleanup is called always except for cases when self.times_teardown_called=1?

Line:69, pytests/transfer/cbtransfertests.py -> I'm not sure but 'done' is pretty common word and it may not apply to the final result. Is there a way to narrow the search, the last line or something else?
