Line:1, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> from xdcr.xdcrnewbasetests import XDCRNewBaseTest, OPS?

Line:12, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> You have removed ddoc_ops and ddoc_ops_dest from .conf, so no need to declare these here.

Line:26, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> where is self.cluster used?

Line:27, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> self.gen_create is not needed unless you want to redefine the generator.

Line:30, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> pls remove whitespace

Line:74, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> the previous step self.setup_xdcr_and_load() handles load as well based on the topology. So load from generator is not needed. The following 2 lines are not needed either.

Line:84, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> why not just use self._wait_timeout? If ok, pls remove 
self.wait_timeout = self._wait_timeout;

Line:88, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> Based on first comment, self.ddoc_ops and self.ddoc_ops_dest will always be None. Just calling self.async_perform_update_delete() instead of 

tasks = []	
:
:           
task.result(self._poll_timeout)

should do.

Line:102, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> by this, you are redefining the "items" parameter value passed to the test.
in basetestclass, it is defined as -
self._num_items = self._input.param("items", 1000)
Why do we need this _num_items here?

Line:104, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> verify_src used to be a param we passed before. Earlier, this was used to skip validations for source cluster. Now, we need to validate both src and dest clusters. So pls pass "True" to _verify_views.

Line:1, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> Done

Line:12, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> I have removed doc_ops and doc_ops_dest. These are design docs (ddocs) related params required for the view tests

Line:26, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> This is used in _run_ddoc_ops() and also required in the code path followed by _async_execute_ddoc_ops()

Line:27, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> Done

Line:30, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> Done

Line:74, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> Done

Line:84, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> _execute_ddoc_ops in view/createdeleteview.py requires the timeout variable to be  self.wait_timeout - we cannot change in that function as it is called in many other places

Line:88, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> As mentioned in my previous reply, these are view related design docs (ddocs) operation required for this test case - so keeping it

Line:102, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> Done

Line:104, pytests/view/xdcrview.py -> Done
