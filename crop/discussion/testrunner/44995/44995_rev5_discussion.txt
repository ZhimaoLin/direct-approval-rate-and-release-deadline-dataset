Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

I was unable to set 'n1ql'  see comments.  can you put example of use in commit msg?

Line:135, pytests/basetestcase.py -> this didn't work for me because passing in 1 node to get_services  at least 2 nodes for some reason.

I tried testrunner using a 4 node ini and params:
-p services_init=n1ql

is that correct?

Patch Set 5:

services_init=<service seperated by deleimited ":">separated by delimiter "-".

If we have only 1 definition i.e. services_init=kv then all initial nodes in the nodes are kv (data) only

otherwise we have to define for as many nodes we want to add.

Note that this overrides anything that .ini file defines.

Also, first node cannot be just n1ql, it MUST be data as well. We can add an exception for this case, just to make sure the tester is not running into issues
