DESCRIPTION

MB-13665: Initialize cluster for viewmerge tests

I'm not sure why the call to `cluster.async_init_node()` is needed in order
to make the `view.viewmergetests.ViewMergingTests.test_stale_ok_alternated_doc`
test pass. But without the call it fails.

This is a hack around the problem that the viewmerge tests run without cleaning
up the cluster between runs. This setup got broken with commit
96b5599ba2428599e3b034a23aefc79a86b69afd [1]. The fix with commit
4a7eede6921cabd196141c0f9b461e58527ae0f9 [2] made it almost work, besides the
one test mentioned above.

Joyce Webster, Harsha, please verify that it fixes the test failure (as it doesn't happen on the build bots).

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

I just can't give up and still searching for the root cause. Hence I give it a -2 for now, so that no one merges accidentally.

Though reviews and verifications are welcome.

It's a timing issue and has nothing to do with setting up the cluster. I'll try a proper fix.
