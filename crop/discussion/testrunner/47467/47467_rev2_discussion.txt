DESCRIPTION

MB-13665: Initialize cluster for viewmerge tests

For `updater_after` requests there's an internal stats cache within the view
engine. The current timeout is 0.3 seconds. This means that you might see
outdated update sequence numbers for up to 0.3 seconds. Hence add a sleep so
we can be sure the view engine retrieves the most current update sequence.
