Patch Set 1:

Trevor Santana, as for the test failure, can you do the same kind of debugging/analysis Tommie did for MB-5534 / MB-5331 ?

Post mortem analysis to check if the test just didn't do enough retires / waited enough, if the docs got persisted to disk, etc.

Patch Set 1:

I still see the data loader thread crash.
But this change is not about the data loader thread (it's another change), right?

Ok, sorry I confused this with http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17683.
I thought it was that changed that would fix the issue, but I now read it better and see it's not.
will try it now thanks

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Ok.
So this seems to work, running py-viewquery.conf on Linux and OS X, so far 12 tests passed successfully, before the very first test in the suite would fail with the data loader thread crash.

thanks guys

Patch Set 1:

since the loader is not crashing anymore with this change we can workon the other fix Trevor Santana has to the multi-thread query/loading code and provide a better fix for that.
