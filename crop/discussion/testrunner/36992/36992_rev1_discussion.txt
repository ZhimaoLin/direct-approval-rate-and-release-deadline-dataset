For cases like MB-10856 where uni-xdcr causes data inconsistency at source but all is well at destination.

Patch Set 1:

what is the purpose of this?
assumed that behavior of sour—Åe(one cluster) is checked in not XDCR tests. before there was much tNathalie Landry about test optimizing their speed. but they are becoming longer and longer.

it's simpler to change "def verify_results(self, verify_src=True):" then all tests where it's called.

this is how we handled it in http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/37055/

verifying source items is an important check which we havent been doing so far in uni-xdcr tests. pls refer MB-10856.
