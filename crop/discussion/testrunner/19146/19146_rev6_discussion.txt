Patch Set 6: Do not submit

1)all funcs should be parameterized, now they are almost the same. 2)Also, why there are so much test classes with the similar verification. 3)it is not necessary to specify the parameters in conf file that are default. 4)all tests that don't contains body( only : pass) will be passed now. 5)I'm not sue that it's a good idea to create func's headers and then add implementation. many of tests can be parameterized during implementation, the logic can be changed, etc. I've seen in testrunner the functions that are still not implemented.
