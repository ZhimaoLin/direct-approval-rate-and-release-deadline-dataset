I had already noted this in my comment on MB-10792 -

" Pls note _all_docs is not functional anymore, for manual tests use views, for test runner implementation, we need to do getMeta() on all keys from cluster1, compare it against all keys in cluster2 i.e, force control to verify revids and log keys that are not present in the other cluster when item counts don't match between clusters(and not just stop the tests there)."
