DESCRIPTION

CBQE-4390:
STEP 1 of RQG Expansion - implementing old tests with new syntax.
Need to also create a jenkins job for the new syntax.
Summary:
added a flag called ansi_joins which alters some of the control logic in certain methods. Also altered _build_indexes to make a secondary index on the primary_key field for each bucket loaded in.
