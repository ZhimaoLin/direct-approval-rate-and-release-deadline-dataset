DESCRIPTION

CBQE-4390:
STEP 1 of RQG Expansion - implementing old tests with new syntax.
Need to also create a jenkins job for the new syntax.
Summary:
added a flag called ansi_joins which alters some of the control logic in certain methods. Also altered _build_indexes to make a secondary index on the primary_key field for each bucket loaded in.

Line:1577, pytests/rqg/test_rqg.py -> Let's add logging for all the function that a relevant to RQG, so these print statements will at least tell use where in the code they are coming from.

Line:1062, lib/couchbase_helper/query_helper.py -> I don't see where ansi_joins is defines in this scope
