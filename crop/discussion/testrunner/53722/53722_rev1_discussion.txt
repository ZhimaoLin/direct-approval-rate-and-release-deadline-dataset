DESCRIPTION

CBQE:2961 Tunable XDCR test hangs with key error on 'C2-key-398'

This happens because- when we load till say 90% active resident ratio on source bucket, they keys are getting xdcred all the time. So when we're done loading src bucket to the specified dgm, if there is no network lag, dest bucket would also be at the same active resident % as a result of which we do not load more keys into C2.

However the update, delete logic still relies on the "items" count assuming these keys were loaded into all xdcr source buckets. Since we did not load any keys into C2, it's kvstore throws KeyError when we try to update a non-existing key. So to fix this issue, we must first load keys specified using "items" arg and only then do addiitonal loading to achieve dgm.
