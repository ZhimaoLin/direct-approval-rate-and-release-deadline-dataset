Patch Set 3:

Oops, merged too quickly. There are only 3 compaction tests where we set moss_compact_threshold. If we now pass level_compaction=True and moss_compact_threshold=10, we  will have something like
{"store": {"mossStoreOptions": {"CompactionLevelMultiplier": 3, "CompactionPercentage": 10, "CompactionLevelMaxSegments": 9}, "kvStoreName": "mossStore"}}

The above configuration is not incorrect, just that a value of 10 for compaction will basically end up disabling level compactions completely and go to default compaction mode.
