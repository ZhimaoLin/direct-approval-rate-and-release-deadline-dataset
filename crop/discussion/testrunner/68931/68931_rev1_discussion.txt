Line:221, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> Suggestion: Won't it be better to have a single variable for edition_type that is either couchbase-server-community or couchbase-server-enterprise so that you don't need to actually call the function in both parts. Instead can pass the variable into a single call.
