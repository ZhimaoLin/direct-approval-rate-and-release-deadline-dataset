why don't use 'status, content, _ =..' where it's possible?

Patch Set 4:

I think 'status, content, header =..' 
makes the code easier to understand for anyone looking at it.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

additional param in code is added but it's never used. so it's python.... For example, if one sees that only 2 params are used it makes him think that third one is unnecessary.
