Patch Set 1:

This looks like the built-in sched, but without future scheduling.  The Task class looks like it could be a good model of a continuation-based cooperative multithreading, but I think the FSM model should be more explicit and the toplevel API should represent that a bit first class.  I have to imagine there are a lot of these things already built (e.g. twisted does a great job of this, but gevent likely has newer, more advanced things).

Patch Set 1:

I actually haven't thought about scheduling future tasks here, but that could bring a lot of benefits to the testing api. I'll take a look into those other libraries too to see if I can simplify things more and not have to rewrite something that's already been done. If you have a few minutes tomorrow maybe I can give you a quick rundown of my current ideas and see if you have any other thought on how this could be even better. Thanks for the feedback.
