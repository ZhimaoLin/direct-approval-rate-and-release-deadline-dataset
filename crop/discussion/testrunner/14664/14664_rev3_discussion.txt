Patch Set 3: (2 inline comments)

Somewhat of a proposal for standardizing on task state transitions.

In the Task superclass can we set state to "pending" and task manager will handle the remaining transitions:

pending -> inprogress -> complete

Line:19, lib/tasks/taskmanager.py -> I thought about adding a check here to make sure what we pass in a Task instance  but required import of Task.  Perhaps at least checking that task is not 'None' for now

Line:43, lib/tasks/task.py -> typo?  "Exception"

Tommie,

You had some vald comments here, one of which was an issue that would cause a compile error. Why did you push this through?
