Line:87, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> log e.message or dont use e

Line:119, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> 256 not when in dgm=True right?

Line:267, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> I have no idea what this code block is trying to achieve. 

few comments here would help us all :)

Line:84, pytests/xdcr-mod/uniXDCR.py -> This should be a method... its being reused multiple times.

Line:9, pytests/xdcr-mod/biXDCR.py -> You should fail the test if this condition is not met

Line:34, pytests/xdcr-mod/biXDCR.py -> Why cant we move this to the base test class?

You are using it both uni and bi test cases

Line:61, pytests/xdcr-mod/biXDCR.py -> It should be "update" in self._doc_ops_dest?

Line:574, pytests/xdcr-mod/biXDCR.py -> This block of code should be a method

Patch Set 3:

the main idea the changes was not code refactor, it was done only to switch to have separate buckets for each cluster in XDCR. next iteration will be code refactor all of these tests. certain comments make sense, I correct them
