DESCRIPTION

Make spatial tests work with Python 2.7

It isn't a good idea to subclass unittest.TestCase for
the SpatialHelper class, as it is not really a test case.
The better approach is to initiate the SpatialHelper class
with the original test case. This way we can still have
assertions.

Previously the tests based on SpatialHelper only worked
with Python 2.6. This change makes it compatible with
Python 2.7.
