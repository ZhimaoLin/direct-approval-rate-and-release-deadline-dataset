(18 inline comments)

general mistakes: there is no conf file, not all variables are defined, also look at my comments in Deep's commit http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17266

Line:49, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> where default.map_fun and default_red_func are defined? (for all cases)

Line:53, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> can we keep the tests funcs together, one by one, and support functions separately

Line:59, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> I saw Deep use the same func, move it in ViewBaseTest

Line:63, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> use self.cluster.create_view everywhere

Line:72, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> self.cluster.create_view instead

Line:81, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> self.cluster.create_view instead

Line:85, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> use with parameter

Line:86, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> #1 add self.default_ddoc_name in ViewBaseTest, you can use it everywhere( the same for Deep's tests)

Line:95, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> #1

Line:99, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> empty line here

Line:104, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> #1

Line:115, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> self.cluster.create_view instead

Line:121, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> #1

Line:141, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> what we expect here?

Line:161, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> what we expect here?

Line:165, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> lowercase

Line:180, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> remove rest

Line:188, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> don't use hard code, i think you can't add fake server
creds = self.input.membase_settings
rest.add_node(creds.rest_username, creds.rest_password, self.servers[i].ip, self.servers[i].port)
