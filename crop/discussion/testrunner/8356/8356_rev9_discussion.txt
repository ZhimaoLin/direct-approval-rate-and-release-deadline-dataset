DESCRIPTION

added tests to create views on multiple nodes

if we dont get all the expected items we should wait
for a bit before trying again
also added a test for inserting 100k items and then
getting the views
added a helper method to cluster_helper to add and
rebalance all nodes
modified teardown method to cleanup the cluster if
nodeStatuse() returns multiple nodes
