DESCRIPTION

Add _verify_keys for faster verification

In my quick tests the _verify_keys function is about 10x faster
than the  _verify_docs_doc_name. It doesn't need to create a
MapReduce View.

This commit also changes _get_key to always return ASCII values.
This makes the comparison with the inserted keys easier (else
we need to convert the doc_names to unicode) and we have ASCII
compatible keys anyway.
