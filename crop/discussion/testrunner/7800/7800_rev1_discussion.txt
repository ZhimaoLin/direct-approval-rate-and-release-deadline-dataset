Line:166, scripts/install.py -> do we need a initialize method for css ?

also to be able to run tests against css remotely we need to modify that default or local.ini file.

Line:197, scripts/install.py -> does membase_install method take care of css installation?

Line:166, scripts/install.py -> css should start up automatically after the install, i couldn't see any initialization that needed to be done

Line:197, scripts/install.py -> it works, but i can just create a separate function anyway because that may change in the future
