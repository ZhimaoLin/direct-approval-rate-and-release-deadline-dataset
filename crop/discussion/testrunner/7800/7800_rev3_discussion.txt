Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved

(1 inline comment)

thanks for making the changes.

check with Tony to make sure the changes to membase_install are not breaking existing windows installation

will leave it up to you to merge once you are done with testing.

Line:350, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> this requires Tony's change which copies all those files to automation as part of the installation but we can check it in if it doesn't break existing membase install functionality

Patch Set 3: Verified

This code runs to install couchbase on one of my box but don't merge it yet.  I need to verify it will not brake membase installation.
