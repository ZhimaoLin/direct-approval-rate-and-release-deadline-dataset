This change should utilize the DesignDocument class.

Line:208, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Use the DesignDocument class in lib/couchbase/document.py

Yes, the design_doc_object I'm passing in is an instance of the DesignDocument class.  When "stringified" it becomes json.

I believe the design documents name is kept in the id field of the design document so you don't need to pass in the design documents name.

Line:208, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> My last comment is on the function signature. Why not def create_design_document(self, bucket, design_doc) ?

Line:208, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Also if you think bucket_name is more clear then that's fine with me too.
