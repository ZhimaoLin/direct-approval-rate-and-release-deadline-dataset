DESCRIPTION

Fix for wait_for_memcached

wait_for_memcached earlier threw an error,
when a bucket is created for a cluster after rebalancing.
The Fix: Removed redundant code from wait_for_memcached,
and added cases in wait_for_vbuckets_ready_state()
that will cover both scenarios of when executed using
cluster_run or on a set of vms.
Had missed a corner case the last time,
included a condition for checking whether
the current execution is a cluster_run or not.
Patch 14: Removed redundanies and incorporated suggested changes
pointed out in patch 11 and 13.
