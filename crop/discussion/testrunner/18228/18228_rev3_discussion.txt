Patch Set 3: Do not submit

This seems to be going in infinite loop on cluster_run.

(2 inline comments)

As Karan mentions, it doesn't work with cluster_run. I've digged a bit deeper. See more info in the inline comments.

Overall this change has a lot of duplicated code that looks almost identical. I'd prefer if you would refactor it to make it easier to understand.

Line:208, lib/membase/helper/bucket_helper.py -> Please be more precise about what the list is. I think it's the list of vbuckets for that specific server

Line:217, lib/membase/helper/bucket_helper.py -> Somehow the lists are empty, hence this loop never takes place.
This leads to len(ready_vbuckets) being always 0. Hence an endless loop (as Karan mentioned).

Patch Set 3:

I forgot to mention that you can easily see the endless loop behaviour when you run on the spatial tests like:


./testrunner -i b/resources/dev-4-nodes.ini  -t spatialinfotests.SpatialInfoTests.test_spatial_info
