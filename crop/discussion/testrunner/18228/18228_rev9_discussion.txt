Patch Set 9: Do not submit

This issue is still not fixed.

When I run with ./testrunner -i b/resources/dev-4-nodes.ini -t spatialinfotests.SpatialInfoTests.test_spatial_info

I still get errors like:

[2012-07-17 16:23:36,104] - [bucket_helper:249] ERROR - Memcached error #7 'Not my vbucket':  That's not my bucket. for vbucket :0 to mc 192.168.178.26:12006
