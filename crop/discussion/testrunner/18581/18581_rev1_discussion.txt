@karan,

This is meant to enable retrial when rebalance fails, mainly for eperf tests.

During a retrial, we don't have to re-add the node, but just a simulation of clicking the 'Rebalance' button. 

In order to minimize change and reuse the rebalance_helper function...

The perf change is on http://review.couchbase.org/#change,18582
