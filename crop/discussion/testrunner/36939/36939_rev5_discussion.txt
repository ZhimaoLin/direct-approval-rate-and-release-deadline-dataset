Line:4, conf/py-ibr.conf -> why we don't use more items? you set items=10 but max_verify=1000. it's the number of items in the bucket?

Line:31, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> As I understand in your tests you use 10 items. do we really need a thorough cleaning in python for such small data?

Line:4, conf/py-ibr.conf -> These values are temporary. The values are going to alot larger when I run them Jenkin jobs.

Line:31, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> Yes, this is very conclusive. But do have better idea? The test data is going to be alot more. The reason the conf file has such small values is more me to able to quickly verify the script working. Once I merge with Jenkins the conf file values will change.

Line:4, conf/py-ibr.conf -> I'm confused, so it will be commited in git to run on jenkins? or it's still not the last version?

Line:2, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> time never used

Line:7, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> what are you using from data_analysis_helper?

Line:62, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> still do not understand why we can not use _bucket_creation

Line:92, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> still do not understand why we can not use _bucket_creation

Line:113, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> still do not understand why we can not use _bucket_creation

Line:4, conf/py-ibr.conf -> No this is not the final version. I have more scripts comming and these values are going to change.

Line:2, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> There is more code which is being added in the later version where I use time and data analysis version.

Line:7, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> There are more test cases being added in this module, which will use this module. Consider this first release of the module.

Line:62, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> please read my comment below

Line:92, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> it gives me flexibility to give options in py-conf file to _not_ create sasl or standard buckets. Please see the conf file I have not used this for full backup.

Line:113, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> please read my comment above

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:92, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> in _bucket_creation method, if you want to create standard or sasl bucket, just set parameter standard_buckets=1,sasl_buckets=1 in conf file.  By default, _bucket_creation only create default bucket.  If you don't want to create any bucket, set default_bucket=False

Line:2, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> believe that the review does not make sense in this case. I do not know what you will have in the next iteration. I can only check the current version.

Line:92, pytests/backup/ibr.py -> Right, and all these parameters already set in config file: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/36939/5/conf/py-ibr.conf

in general steps are simple:
create_all_buckets
delete_all_buckets
create_all_bukcets
