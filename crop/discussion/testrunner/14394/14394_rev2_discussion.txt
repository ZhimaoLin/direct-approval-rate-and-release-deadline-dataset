Patch Set 2: (2 inline comments)

See inline comments.

Line:20, lib/couchbase/view_helper.py -> You don't really assert things, but you throw an error. I'm not even sure if it should be an assertion error, or rather just another exception.

In case you want to have an AssertionError, it would be better to use:

  raise AssertionError("Query error {0} due to {1}".format(view, results.get(u'errors'))

(this is from http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement)

Line:32, lib/couchbase/view_helper.py -> Same as for the `assert` above.
