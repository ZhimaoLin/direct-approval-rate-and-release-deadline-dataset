Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Same here.  Does a bunch of stuff, summary is too long to display in the tools.

BTW, part of the review (obviously) is ensuring the contribution has a meaningful message so when you're debugging or something you can know why someone did something.  Imagine yourself from that perspective and it gets easier.  Everyone gets lots of -1s.  :)
