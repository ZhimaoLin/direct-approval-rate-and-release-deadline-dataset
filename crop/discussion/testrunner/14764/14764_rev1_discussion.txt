Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

I have a few other comments, but in the interest if getting this in on time I think these are the only ones that should be addressed now.

Line:18, lib/tasks/taskmanager.py -> Why do we need a sleep value here?

Line:30, lib/tasks/taskmanager.py -> We don't want to put a task back on the sleep queue and wait for completion. Tasks should be rescheduling themselves.

Line:214, lib/tasks/task.py -> For consistency let's change pending to initializing and completed to finished.

Line:30, lib/tasks/taskmanager.py -> we can tNathalie Landry about the +/- of that.... if we just check that the task has reached a complete stage then we won't have check+reschedule in our tests.  I do see your point.
