Patch Set 3: (3 inline comments)



Line:258, lib/tasks/task.py -> Logger is initialize in the Task class so we don't need to initialize it here.

Line:259, lib/tasks/task.py -> rest, bucket and res are set in a super class

Line:289, lib/tasks/task.py -> I think we should make the run function continue looping as opposed to scheduling tasks recursively.
