DESCRIPTION

CBQE-4138: fix verification of expiry items

This test used to timeout because the curr_items stat
never reached 0 even though all items are expired.
The fix here is to attempt to fetch all the items
which actually verifies that curr_items are 0, and also
that items expected to be ejected no longer exist.
