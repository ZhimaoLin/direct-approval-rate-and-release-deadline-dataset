I think, we should not submit this.. 

I have been trying to get rid of get_distribution functionality.

(5 inline comments)

comments were added. will break commits into small parts in the future

Line:60, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> to this method we can only pass self.do_ascii parameter

Line:626, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> parameters ram_tation and distribution were not defined

Line:302, lib/membase/helper/rebalance_helper.py -> It's not important the number of stats_received. would be logical to use a boolean here

Line:340, lib/membase/helper/rebalance_helper.py -> a/b*c != a/(b*c)

if sum =0 -> missing_percentage should be 1 (we use a fraction)

Line:346, lib/membase/helper/rebalance_helper.py -> the same result but the extra check
