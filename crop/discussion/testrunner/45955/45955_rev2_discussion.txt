Line:123, pytests/xdcr/biXDCR.py -> oh I thought this was merged already and started regression again. Anyway, I don't think we should remove tests where we perform updates/deletes on clusters at the same time. Instead, we can catch any exceptions that arises to make sure we just have the same doc on both sides - say a verify_random_resolution() that just checks revID and cas on both sides for the same key. What do you think?
