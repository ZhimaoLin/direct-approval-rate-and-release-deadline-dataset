Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)



Line:53, pytests/autocompaction.py -> I think this error message should be "Need to set minimum threshold above {0}".

Similar to the max threshold below.

Line:521, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> The variable name "pre" is not very descriptive. Perhaps calling it "compacting" may be better.

It seems like "pre" and "post" could be the same variable.

Line:525, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> This "if not post:" block seems redundant. As well as the "ended" variable.

compacting, vBucket = rest.check_compaction_status(bucket)
while compacting:
    log.info("compacting vBucket {0}".format(vBucket))
    time.sleep(1)
    compacting, vBucket = rest.check_compaction_status(bucket)
