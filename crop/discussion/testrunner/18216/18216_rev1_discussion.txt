DESCRIPTION

CBD-442: Remove long running test

The tests just do the same as the ones that run
only 1 minute. I don't expect to discover any
failure that isn't catched by the shorter running
version.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

I dare to self-verify it, so that the tests finally can get run on a regular basis.
