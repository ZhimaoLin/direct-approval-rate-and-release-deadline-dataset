DESCRIPTION

CBQE-1842 : Makefile changes for view-tests.
Cleaned up the code for multiple instances of test-view-XXX to singular
test-viewmerge for a 4 node cluster. Merged py-premerge and py-view-merge as singular
py-viewmerge.conf to run before merging any view related code. The new
syntax for view-merge tests now is : make test-viewmerge

Line:30, Makefile -> Please do not remove viewquery target from Makefile. It is still useful to have them on makefile.

Line:1, conf/view-conf/py-viewmerge.conf -> Would it be OK to move the view-premerge.conf tests at the bottom of the file? They are longer running and I find it more convenient if the short running stuff runs first.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Please don't submit for now. Currently I've changes in review on the upr branch that only pass the py-viewmerge but not the py-view-pre-merge tests. Once they are reviewed and merged also the py-view-pre-merge tests will pass. So I'm just asking for not merging this right now, but pretty soon.

Patch Set 1: -Code-Review

My comment with the different order is still valid, but it's no longer blocked by the changes on the upr branch. All those changes I wanted to wait for are merged now.
