DESCRIPTION

CBQE-1842 : Makefile changes for view-tests.
Cleaned up the code for multiple instances of test-view-XXX to singular
test-viewmerge for a 4 node cluster. Merged py-premerge and py-view-merge as singular
py-viewmerge.conf to run before merging any view related code. The new
syntax for view-merge tests now is : make test-viewmerge
