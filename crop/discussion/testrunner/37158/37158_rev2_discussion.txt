Patch Set 2:

- Fixed failover for num_failed_nodes=2, was not working
- Fixed graceful failover check for rebalance for num_failed_nodes=2
- Removed 2 tests which were bound to fail due to data-loss scenario. These are negative tests, will add them later, not a high priority
- Changed Data_analysis_helper to support None type check. Which indicates filter the check. This is now applicable to data comparison to avoid failures due to data persistence bugs
