DESCRIPTION

CBQE:0 Change default xdcr protocol to xmem from capi in all testrunner tests

Make simple, sanity tests and many other important suites are still testing capi replication which is going to be deprecated soon.
In Sherlock, we support capi only for Elastic Search.
So CAPI is out of scope of general xdcr testing now onwards.
