Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

(3 comments)

leaving some minor comments. looks good to me anyway.

Line:432, pytests/fts/stable_topology_fts.py -> ok, can we just call es load method?

Line:434, pytests/fts/stable_topology_fts.py -> do you want to enclose this in a try except as well to see how many queries fail?

Line:462, pytests/fts/stable_topology_fts.py -> why not raise error here directly? there's no rqg in this test.
