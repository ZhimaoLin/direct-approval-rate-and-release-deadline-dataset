DESCRIPTION

CBQE-4204: Add backup merge tests for cbbackupmgr
Created new base class for backup merge tests. The class contains methods to perform all backup and merge releated actions based on the params of the test. Added method to perform the actions based on the test input param "actions", where the complete set of actions can be specified to be run in the test.
Added a basic test to run the backup merge scenarios using the newly created class.
