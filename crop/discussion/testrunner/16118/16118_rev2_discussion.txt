Line:10, scripts/perf/rel_cri_stats.py -> I think this approach is too complicated.

Line:18, scripts/perf/rel_cri_stats.py -> Code conventions: I'd recommend to use upper case for constants.

Line:54, scripts/perf/rel_cri_stats.py -> I'd recommend to use "with" construction.

Line:165, scripts/perf/rel_cri_stats.py -> Probably it's better to print status in Timer object.
