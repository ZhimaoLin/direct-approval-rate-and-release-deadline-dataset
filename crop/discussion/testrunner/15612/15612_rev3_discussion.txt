Line:215, scripts/install.py -> Accidentally spotted this. Glad to see you on board btw.

I think that polluting code with calls to shutdown is suboptimal. It is imho clearly not needed in this particular case.

and btw you seem to be leaking socket in False case.

Also I'd pick better name for this function because it seems to be waiting until condition becomes true rather than merely verifying it
