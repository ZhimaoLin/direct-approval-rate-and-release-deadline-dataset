DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3776: reduce processes on mult-bucket loading

High Throughput mode spawns 4 processes / per-bucket.
When loading to 7 buckets then it's possible to have
28 processes going concurrently which leads to diminishing returns
and possibly hangs.

This change applies a global semaphore to ensure that the
maximum number of desired processes is never exceeded
