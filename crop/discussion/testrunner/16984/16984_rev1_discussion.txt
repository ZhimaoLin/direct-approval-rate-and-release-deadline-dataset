Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Verified it with Makefile. 

Just a comment on the conf/file -
# Note: this test only passes after we manutally disable the compactor. Once the bug in
# compactor get fixed, we should turn on compactor. Look at test code for details

Is this still valid?
