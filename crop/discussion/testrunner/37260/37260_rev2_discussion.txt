Patch Set 2:

Andrei, Please two more support to this script:

1. Support for xdcr_upr parameter.
2. Flexibility for test_params, same as -p option in testrunner. Because for downstream jobs, parameters from upstream job is inherited by downstream jobs. Please ignore this support if we have better solution in jenkins itself.
