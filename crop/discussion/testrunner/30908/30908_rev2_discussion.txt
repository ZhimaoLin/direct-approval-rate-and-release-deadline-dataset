Line:1001, lib/tasks/task.py -> why we need the hardcode in task? self.batch_size could be as 1K, 10K, ... not all of them can be verified for 15 seconds, for various reasons

Line:1001, lib/tasks/task.py -> I am not sure if batch_size could do much here, because if you see MB-9690 here only 3 threads were running and all 3 were unfinished.
