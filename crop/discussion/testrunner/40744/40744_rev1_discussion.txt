Line:13, Makefile -> Nit, but I prefer keeping simple-test-ng where it was and then having an explicit:

    default: simple-test-ng
    .PHONY: default

rule as the first target in the file - then it's obvious to non-experts that this is the default target.

Just realized we have to hold off on this until the result logging is implemented for this target
