Line:67, pytests/swaprebalance.py -> I guess self.num_buckets is not visible here because SwapRebalanceBase doesn't extend BaseTestCase

Line:67, pytests/swaprebalance.py -> Yes, I wanted to minimize function overlap, so added this here.
Added more changes to have all the existing tests to support change_max_buckets which is based of total_buckets as on the BaseTest.

If you recommend keeping SwapRebalance out of BaseTestCase extension, I can add that change - but will duplicate the change_bucket module again here.
