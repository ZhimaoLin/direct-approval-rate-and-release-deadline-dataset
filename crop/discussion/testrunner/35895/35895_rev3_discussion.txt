Pls merge the code with the new changes. Otherwise looks ok to me.

Line:1151, lib/tasks/task.py -> Can we also append the key to this msg?

Line:1171, lib/tasks/task.py -> Need to locally merge this code with my other merge today.

Line:1174, lib/tasks/task.py -> Does Memcached return ERR_NOT_FOUND error for getMeta() on deleted keys?

Just remembered 2 more things while driving home.

Line:1165, lib/tasks/task.py -> We also need to log vbucket id for missing and meta-mismatched keys.  Can we call get_vbucket_id?

Line:1174, lib/tasks/task.py -> If they key is not present in source cluster but is in kv_store what would happen? We would get an ERR_NOT_FOUND Memc exception and if it is not a deleted key, the test would just stop there.
