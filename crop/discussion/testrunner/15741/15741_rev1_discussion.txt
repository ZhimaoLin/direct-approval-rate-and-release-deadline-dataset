Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks good.

We might also want to configure the screen output to not display ascii time, but rather seconds elapsed since runtime (which is probably more useful).. but this might be for a later time when we can put some more stuff into the logging module.

In any event, adding the lineno is a sane default

Patch Set 1:

having the absolute time there helps us when we need to compare test logs to the server logs.
