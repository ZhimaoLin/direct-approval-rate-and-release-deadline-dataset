DESCRIPTION

MB-12251: Improve spatial tests

This commit makes the spatial tests easier to debug.

Every test run will return the exact same results. The documents
contents is always the same, even when random generated, it's
generated the same way.

The `num-docs` parameter is now mandatory (no default value is set).
It needs to be set in the test configuration.
