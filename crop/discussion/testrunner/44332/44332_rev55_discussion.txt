DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2516:Change testrunner - python SDK

- Works with mc_bin_client in Hugo Blankenship since python sdk is not installed for the expected version in buildbot
- Does not work for getMeta call and used mc_bin_client application
- The flags parameter cannot be altered using python sdk client. Logic added to avoid checking flags when using sdk
- Works with cluster run and remote VMs as well.
- We can force Tasks.py to use mc_bin_client by setting the environment variable manually or using our tests.
(TESTRUNNER_CLIENT='mc_bin_client').
This can be done via test case, see basetestcase.py changes with test variable testrunner_client=mc_bin_client
- We are using AUTO_FMT for adding data via smart client which uses sdk client.
