Got some more errors... see comments.  I think your tests passed because the sdk_client module didn't load.  

Just running simple-test should suffice and be sure the sdk is being used.  Looks like old code paths are ok.

Line:318, lib/sdk_client.py -> Error:  'SDKSmartClient' object has no attribute 'bucket'

this is because self.bucket is set when bucket is an object but if it's a string you need an 'else' case to set it as well as you have for saslpassword

Line:341, lib/sdk_client.py -> invalid syntax here.

Line:344, lib/sdk_client.py -> invalid syntax
