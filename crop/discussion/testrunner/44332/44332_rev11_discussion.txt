Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Some issues with compatibility in tasks.py.  

Also, can you verify this with several components?  at least view and xdcr tests.

Line:7, lib/sdk_client.py -> remove this try since nothing is being done about the exception and it's being re-raised which means handling still has to be done in external modules.

Line:104, lib/sdk_client.py -> what is this method remove_remove?

Line:310, lib/sdk_client.py -> 3rd option "params" needs to be non mandatory for backward compatibility as VBAwareClient

Line:1284, lib/tasks/task.py -> I didn't see implementation for getMeta

Line:2934, lib/tasks/task.py -> will break with new sdk

Line:7, lib/sdk_client.py -> makes sense

Line:2934, lib/tasks/task.py -> great catch
