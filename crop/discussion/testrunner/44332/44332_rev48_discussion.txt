DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2516:Change testrunner - python SDK

- Works with mc_bin_client in Hugo Blankenship since python sdk is not installed for the expected version in buildbot
- Does not work for getMeta call and used mc_bin_client application
- The flags parameter cannot be altered using python sdk client. Logic added to avoid checking flags when using sdk
- Works with cluster run and remote VMs as well.
- We can force Tasks.py to use mc_bin_client by setting the environment variable manually or using our tests. 
(TESTRUNNER_CLIENT='mc_bin_client'). 
This can be done via test case, see basetestcase.py changes with test variable testrunner_client=mc_bin_client

Thanks Parag, I had some errors on the import ... see comments

Line:288, lib/sdk_client.py -> looks like a typo 'data.' 

also you can remove this unless some sort of translate of data is supposed to happen.

Line:291, lib/sdk_client.py -> remove (see above)

Line:31, lib/tasks/task.py -> This needs to be defined:  testconstants.TESTRUNNER_CLIENT
