Patch Set 1:

Tommie,

I was about to push this change but Mike notified me that you have some other changes you are working on that is not pushed yet.

I and Luca Rhodes are now rewriting the backup/restore tests and i would like to make sure the interface we are using to write the test is not changing :)
