Line:511, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> n1ql port is not equal to servers port

Line:512, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> if not n1ql_port:

Line:516, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> it should have a default one

Line:517, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> you change implementation for my tests, please start it with port only if it is provided

Line:511, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> there is implementation to support via .ini file.  So this will work.

Line:511, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> this won't work, lets say you start couchbase on port 9000 and then you are trying to start n1ql on the 9000, it won't start

Line:516, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> if i would have no port n1ql will start, but according to this line it shouldn't

Line:517, pytests/tuqquery/newtuq.py -> i had no n1ql_port, i start n1ql without it, now the code is started only with port, please don't change the initial logic
