See my inline comments.

Line:348, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> Trevor Santana, this test isn't valid.

After deleting the dev design doc, querying the production one with stale=false will generate the index, therefore you won't be able to tell if the index was recreated.

Here's how it should be done:

1) upload the dev and production design docs - add options/updateMinChanges field set to 0 in the design document bodies, this is to ensure no automatic updates happen - see http://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/QA/Debugging+view+engine+issues+and+reporting+them#Debuggingviewengineissuesandreportingthem-section13

2) query both with stale=false

3) delete the development design doc

4) query the production one with stale=ok

5) Verify that the results you got in step 4 are exactly the same as the ones you got in step 2
