DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3879: improve detection of container memory limits

Some tests are failing to pick up the is_container param
because they do not inherit from BaseTestCase, or if they do,
they do not use the NodeInitTask and thus fail when run
against containers with limited memory.

This change adds container checking within the rest call itself
for use by all consumers
