Line:39, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> while space instead of tab

Line:1, resources/windows/automation/upgrade.bat -> can you create a new file instead of overwriting this ?

we can check in a new file that is upgrade-1.8.1-2.0.bat and then in the code upload this to upgrade.bat on the remote node.

Line:594, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> 2.0.0 here instead of 2.0

Line:601, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> so what you mentioned over skype is that we dont need to run the modify registry script twice for 1.8.1->2.0 upgrade but this part of the code does that. shouldn't we add a new if-else for when
currnet version is 1.8.1 ad new version is 2.0 ?

Line:450, scripts/install.py -> no indent after else?

Line:454, scripts/install.py -> If not downloaded, why should we call membase_install?

Line:113, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> Why we don't have indent after else:

Line:2, conf/py-newupgrade.conf -> Disable all test cases temporarily?
