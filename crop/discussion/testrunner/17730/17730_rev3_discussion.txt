(3 inline comments)

Small changes.

Line:72, pytests/viewtests.py -> Dont we need to call restart_couchbase.. 
ideally this block of code should not be present.

Line:87, pytests/viewtests.py -> All delete before cleanup..

the cleanup_clusters should be called for all servers individually.

Line:20, pytests/basetestcase.py -> a one line comment what is case_number?
