Line:16, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_ascdesc.py -> why are these params passed from inherited class? These should be declared in QueryTesrts to prevent redefinition in test classes inheriting it.

Line:21, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_ascdesc.py -> why in teardown are we logging into a server and sleeping for 20s?

Line:46, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_ascdesc.py -> Comparing results against primary index is not good enough, because the only difference is the fields indexed. The sorting code path is same for fields in the index. RQG is the best way to test this. For non-rqg tests, we need to have static results comparison - say pass a set of doc-ids as expected results. the order must be manually verified before passing to test.

Please add the new validation and upload a changeset.

Line:16, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_ascdesc.py -> In fact tuq.py actually already has a n1ql_port param and scan_consistency param
