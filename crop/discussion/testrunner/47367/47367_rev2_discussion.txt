Line:40, pytests/sg/sg_webhook_base.py -> this code will never be reached

Line:109, pytests/sg/sg_webhook_base.py -> the same condition as above

Line:118, pytests/sg/sg_webhook_base.py -> why you need 'index' variable?
for go_logfile in go_logfiles:  - it should work

Line:135, pytests/sg/sg_webhook_base.py -> python has 'elif' statement. seems like it's more easy to use it then deap inner conditions.

Line:191, pytests/sg/sg_webhook_base.py -> elif

Line:201, pytests/sg/sg_webhook_base.py -> elif

Line:300, pytests/sg/sg_webhook_base.py -> elif
