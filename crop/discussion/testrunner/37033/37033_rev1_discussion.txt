Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

only minor comment: my opinion, it is better to use the same variable names as in basetestcase(self.dgm_run instead of self._dgm_run). The idea that basetestcase & xdcrbasetescase could be used as superclasses for some test suites and ideally it would be good to have super class for them with common initialization/code
