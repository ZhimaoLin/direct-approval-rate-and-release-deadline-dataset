DESCRIPTION

Better error handling for memcached operations

This fixes a bug that caused my code to not get a new memcached
connection when encountering a "not my vbucket" error. This change
also adds better support for handling connections being dropped in
the middle of operations which can happen during a rebalance.

Line:824, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> Any particular reason not to put the retry logic in the common method?
It seems repetitive.. for set/get/delete

Line:824, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> Due to the way this client works we have to pass the connection to the next function. In the case of reconnect of not my vbucket we need to get a new connection so it has to be done in this function. I agree this sucks, but fixing this issue would require making bigger changes to the VBucketAwareMemcached in general.

Line:824, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> I have a bug filed to fix this up, but it requires rewriting a lot of the client code. Farshid wants me to see how I can improve client throughput anyways so it will probably get done with this. I don't think a TODO is appropriate here since it's such a large change. The bug is here http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/CBQE-38. Is this ok with you?
