Line:1046, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> I think we should remove these functions for now. 
not sure that we will have cases: pause the first n replication(randomly)

Line:1054, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> these functions are unnecessary, in many tests rest_conn already declared, we just need to call rest.resume/(pause)_all_replication()

Line:1046, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> We have test that there are multiple replication going on, and we have to pause some replications not all. (Order doesn't matter).

Line:1054, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> These are wrapper functions, and will use in test cases directly.

Line:1046, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> are you tNathalie Landrying about rest plan or what?

Line:1054, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> what are the advantages of such wrapper function?

Line:1046, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> https://docs.google.com/a/globallogic.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsvydDB59LdCdGFHb2Z6X0NWRUNwT1RoMEpoN2J6Q0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0

Line:1054, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> E.g. in uniXDCR.py :- there is test def load_with_ops(self): suppose want to extend test to pause all replication before load data and resume after that.

    def load_with_ops(self):
        self.pause_all_replications(self.src_master)
        self._load_all_buckets(self.src_master, self.gen_create, "create", 0)
        self.resume_all_replications(self.src_master)
        self._modify_src_data()

        self.merge_buckets(self.src_master, self.dest_master, bidirection=False)
        self.sleep(self._timeout / 2)
        self.verify_results()

this is just an example, we are not going to change existing so far.

Line:1046, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> I think the test "Per bucket basis - pausing replication on one bucket must not affect the replication status of another"  ?
how you are going to check that that there is no affection if you don't know exactly  what bucket replication was stopped?

Line:1054, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> but I think it will be the new test or additional condition/param in config(if stop_replication....)
