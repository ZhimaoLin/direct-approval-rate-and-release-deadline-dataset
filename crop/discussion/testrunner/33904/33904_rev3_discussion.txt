Patch Set 3:

I didn't know you were working on this too. My code here at - http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/33914/ (rest-client.py is ready and tested, others are not) I'm working on post-pause and resume validation functions based on the my implementation.

We can see what we need and merge accordingly although we should try to avoid this duplication of effort in future. Thanks.
