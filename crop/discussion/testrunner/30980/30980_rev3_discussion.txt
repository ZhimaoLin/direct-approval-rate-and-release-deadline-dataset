Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:563, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> and what if test is ok with empty cluster? and we want to check, there are no buckets? i think we haven't make an assert here

Line:99, pytests/xdcr/rebalanceXDCR.py -> it was false for all unidirection tests, but now you want to check source also. Why?

Line:102, pytests/xdcr/rebalanceXDCR.py -> if you follow verify_src variable approach, so here also have to be this variable

Line:149, pytests/xdcr/rebalanceXDCR.py -> same as above

Line:206, pytests/xdcr/rebalanceXDCR.py -> same as above

Patch Set 3:

(2 comments)

Line:563, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> It is difficult to verify using test logs if some verification/operation actually performed on the buckets ot not. I will change it to warning though.

Line:99, pytests/xdcr/rebalanceXDCR.py -> Whenever there is any changes at source cluster, we have to verify source also.
