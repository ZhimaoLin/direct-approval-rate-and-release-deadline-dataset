Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)



Line:266, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> looks like this is an extra debugging statement

Line:267, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> instead of special casing all instances of server being an object or a dictionary, its probably better to force it to be one or the other at the top of the function.

Line:292, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> should probably be tabbed over one to the right. it doesn't actually effect functionality but stylistically it seems better
