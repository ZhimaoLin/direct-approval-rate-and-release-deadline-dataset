Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:16, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> xdcr base has self._input

Line:23, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> _timeout

Line:24, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> self._num_items

Line:32, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> redundant copy, it's easier to add server argument to _run_observe, and put self.master as default and just call it here

Line:85, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> as the class has no special methods please do not create new conf file, just add a GROUP in conf file if you want to run them separately. And also as there are only 7 rows, i would not add a new class
