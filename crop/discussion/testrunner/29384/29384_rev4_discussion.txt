Line:11, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> There is a "rdirection" parameter name, please use that only.

Line:20, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> write it as self.wait_timeout = self._timeout and self.num_items = self._num_items to avoid any conflict.

Line:11, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> rdirection not required...we can just use bidirection as true/false

Line:20, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> Done

Line:21, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> This cannot be done. What we can do is to write -
self.wait_timeout = self._timeout and likewise..
