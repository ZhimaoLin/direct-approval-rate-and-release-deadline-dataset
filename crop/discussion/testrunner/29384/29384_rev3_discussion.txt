Line:199, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> no need to add self, it can be called like earlier

Line:23, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> xdcr base test already has the instance _timeout

Line:24, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> xdcrbasetests already have _num_items instance

Line:34, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> why False? you have an argument for that

Line:2, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> Done

Line:23, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> wait_timeout is required in _run_observe() in observetest.py. And as we are passing 'self' in _run_observe(), so we need to pass the same variable names as in observetest.py.

Line:24, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> Same reply as above.

Line:34, pytests/xdcr/observexdcrtest.py -> Done
