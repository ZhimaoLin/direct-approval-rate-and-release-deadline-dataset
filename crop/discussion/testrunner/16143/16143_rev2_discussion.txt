DESCRIPTION

CBQE-98: Handle non-localhost ip address in rebalance task

When using cluster run the localhost address can be 127.0.0.1 or
the actual ip address (ex. 10.0.0.7). This change takes this into
account.

Line:177, lib/tasks/task.py -> Does it work as expected?. I had problems with this before as well. 


>>> import socket
>>> local_ip = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
socket.gaierror: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known

Line:177, lib/tasks/task.py -> I haven't experienced any problems with this code. Can you give an example of why it fails?
