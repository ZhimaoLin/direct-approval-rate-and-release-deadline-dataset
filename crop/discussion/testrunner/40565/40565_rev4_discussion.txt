DESCRIPTION

Shutdown the cluster properly on Windows

Windows differs from Unix/linux with respect to how processes
and their relationship works. By using .kill() resulted in
a lot of the processes erl starts to be running (and a
callstack being printed from Python that signal.SIGKILL
isn't supported..

Line:224, lib/cluster_run_manager.py -> maybe remove the instance.wait() here and use the one below.  then add an else to the platform check:
 
else:
    # unix
    self.instance.kill()



self.instance.wait()
...


this would give a single point of return at end
return

Patch Set 4:

actually I think the code is cleaner the way it is, because for windows we shouldn't run all the other (check for the retcode and do the sigkill and then check for rc == expected_rc
